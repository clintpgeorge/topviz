 </b>
 is a family of extinct whales known from the Oligocene of Australia and New Zealand.

<p>
 There are currently two genera is this family:
 <i>
  Janjucetus
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Mammalodon
 </i>
 . After a new cladistic analysis by Fitzgerald (2010),
 <i>
  Janjucetus
 </i>
 was transferred into Mammalodontidae, thereby making Janjucetidae a junior synonym of Mammalodontidae.

<p>
 Analysing the jaw morphology of the toothed mysticetes, Fitzgerald 2012 found eight mandibular characters unique to the members of Mammalodontidae:

<p>
 From these mandibular features, Fitzgerald 2006 concluded that in mysticetes enlarge oral cavities adapted for suction feeding evolved before mandibular adaptations for bulk filter feeding, like for example kinetic jaw joints.
