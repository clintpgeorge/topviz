   Kentriodon
  </b>
 </i>
 is an extinct species of toothed whale. Fossils have been found in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and the United States.

 <i>
  Kentriodon
 </i>
 was the most diverse of all the kentriodontids, which include three named species and five undescribed species. These were small to medium-sized odontocetes with largely symmetrical skulls, and thought likely to include ancestors of some modern species.
 <i>
  Kentriodon
 </i>
 is also the oldest described kentriodontid genus, reported from the Late Oligocene to the Middle Miocene.

<p>
 Kentriodontines ate small fish and other nectonic organisms; they are thought to have been active echolocators, and might have formed pods. The diversity, morphology and distribution of fossils appear parallel to some modern species.
