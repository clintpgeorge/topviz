 From 1902 to sometimes in the 1920s Selvík was home to a whaling station, built by Norwegians. The Norwegians came to Sørvágur in March or April 1902, they came with the cargo ship "Viking" and with the Norwegian whaling boat "Norddeble". The factory was ready to use in June 1902. Later they built another whaling ship, which they named Selvík after the bay, and they haunted whales in this boat and brought them to the whaling station in Selvík. There were other whaling factories in the Faroe Islands at the same time. Between 1893 and 1905 seven whaling stations were established in the Faroes. These were located in Selvík, Lopra (Suðuroy), Gjánoyri, Norðdepil, Funningsfjørður, Signabøur and Við Áir.
