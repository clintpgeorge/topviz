<h2>
 Production
</h2>
<p>
 A "reimagined" version of Melville's book,
 <i>
  Moby Dick
 </i>
 was shot primarily in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, during late 2009. Costing US$25 million, it is Tele München's most expensive production to date. This adaptation gives Ahab a wife named Elizabeth, although Melville's story lacks female characters. In 1998, producer Robert Halmi Sr. worked on a similar miniseries for the USA Network, starring Patrick Stewart.

 Critical reception
</h3>
<p>
 The miniseries received fairly positive reviews, with an average score of 68/100 assigned by Metacritic. Linda Stasi of the
 <i>
  New York Post
 </i>
 gave the miniseries three stars out of four; Nancy DeWolf Smith of
 <i>
  The Wall Street Journal
 </i>
 also gave it a positive review, but warned that "Purists [of the novel] may go wild" over changes from the original story. Likewise, Hank Stuever of
 <i>
  The Washington Post
 </i>
 called it "a lavish, exciting, well-acted and admirably thorough movie adaptation". The
 <i>
  New York Daily News
 </i>
 ' David Hinckley awarded it three stars out of five, remarking: "The action will hold your attention, though [the miniseries] is really more a drama of character and flaws and faith. At times, in fact, it lapses into melodrama." Alessandra Stanley of
 <i>
  The New York Times
 </i>
 wrote that while "[it] is not entirely silly or even half bad", "it’s an ambitious, beautifully made adventure tale that seeks to be respectful of the book while still making the characters and story accessible to modern viewers." She called the creation of scenes involving Captain Ahab's wife the "most startling" change to Melville's story, noting that the wife was "only fleetingly mentioned" in the original book. Stanley further commented on a few modernized lines in the script, and added, "Some shortcuts and substitutions are useful. Too often, however, the improvisations fall back on clichés that don’t visually distill Melville’s words as much as they forcibly remind viewers of other books and movies."
