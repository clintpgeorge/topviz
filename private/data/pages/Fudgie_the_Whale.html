  Fudgie the Whale

 Development

<p>
 Although the cake depicts the shape of a whale and was originally decorated as such, it was adapted for holiday uses by rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the whale's body, now upright, could represent a face. The whale's tail would then represent whatever a character traditionally had on its head: the Easter Bunny's ears, a leprechaun's hat, or Santa Claus's tassel. Fudgie the Whale was often promoted around Father's Day, using the slogan, "For a whale of a dad."
