 The
 <b>
  RV
  <i>
   Farley Mowat
  </i>
 </b>
 was a long-range, ice class, ship. Originally built as a Norwegian fisheries research and enforcement vessel, it was purchased by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in Edinburgh, Scotland, in August 1996. It is named after Canadian writer Farley Mowat. Its previous name with the group was
 <i>
  Ocean Warrior
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 It was the flagship of Sea Shepherd's fleet until seized by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans off the coast of Newfoundland in April 2008. It was sold for C$5,000 by court order in November 2009., to Green Ship LLC, a company headquartered in Oregon. During 2010 it was moored in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, undergoing refit for operation as an expedition vessel for research in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, by 2011 the ship was on the market again, to cover unpaid docking fees, and was eventually sold in March 2013. The vessel was reportedly scrapped in June 2013.

<h2>
 Career
</h2>
<p>
 The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society used the vessel to monitor international waters for violations of international fisheries agreements. The RV
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 officially began its career in the waters off Costa Rica, immersed in controversy over policing actions against illegal fishing activities.
</p>
<p>
 In March and April 2008, the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was involved in controversy related to the 2008 Canadian commercial seal hunt. On 12 April 2008, Fisheries and Oceans Canada seized the R/V
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 in the Cabot Strait after the ship came near the seal hunt without an observation permit and two collisions with a coast guard vessel occurred. During the raid, the captain and first officer were arrested and later charged for the incident.
</p>
<p>
 While seized, the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was held by Fisheries and Oceans Canada at Sydney, Nova Scotia until put up for sale. The location of the ship at the time of the seizure is controversial.

 The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claims the ship was seized illegally in international waters. The Canadian Fisheries minister claims that the ship was seized in Canadian waters, but also that the Fisheries Act gave him authority to order the boarding outside Canada's territorial waters zone of 12 nautical miles (22 km).
</p>
<p>
 The captain and first officer made a court appearance on 1 May 2008. On 2 July 2008, they entered a plea of not guilty to coming too close to sealers. Convicted in absentia in June 2009 on two counts each of approaching within 926 metres (0.575 mi) of a seal hunt, the pair were sentenced on 10 September 2009 to fines totaling C$45,000.
</p>
<p>
 On 27 February 2009, the Canadian Crown-in-Council announced that the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was being put up for sale to cover approximately C$500,000 in berthing fees accrued since the April 2008 seizure. Subsequently, the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was reportedly sold for C$50,000, but the buyer did not complete the transaction. As of September 2009 the ship was still in the possession of the Canadian government and continued to accrue berthing fees. Sea Shepherd later stated that the seizure of the ship had been expected and, in fact, encouraged. Therefore, it had been used in provocation, with the full intention to have the Canadian government end up with, in their opinion, a more or less worthless vessel.
</p>
<p>
 The Farley Mowat arrived in Halifax on December 18, 2009 for refit and was towed to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where it was tied up as of February 2010

 . It was reported in November 2009 that the vessel has been sold for the sum of C$5,000 to the Green Ship LLC subsidiary of Stephen Munson's organization Tenthmil to be used in a survey of the North Pacific Gyre. As of August 2010

 , the Farley Mowat remained berthed in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia for a refit under the direction of Cliff Hodder. In early 2013, with unpaid docking fees on the order of C$90,000 and Green Ship LLC apparently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ship was sold at a sheriff's auction to an undisclosed buyer. The buyer was later identified as Tracy Dodds of Eastern Scrap and Demolition Services, a Halifax-based company; the purchase price was C$9,200. The vessel was reportedly scrapped in June 2013.

<h2>
 Registration
</h2>
<p>
 The
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 registered under the Canadian flag in April 2002. In October of the same year, the government suspended her registration.
</p>
<p>
 The United Kingdom revoked the ship's registration in early December 2006; the same day it was issued. Sea Shepherd then received registration for her in Belize on 19 December 2006. Ten days later, on 29 December 2006, the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 cleared Australian Customs in Hobart, Tasmania, only hours before Belize struck its flag.

 During 2007, the ship operated without an officially recognised registration flag. In May 2007, Sea Shepherd issued a press release stating that the Mohawk long house of the Iroquois Confederacy, in response to the Canadian government action, had agreed to the ship (and Sea Shepherd's other ship the
 <i>
  Robert Hunter
 </i>
 ) flying their flag. It was not clear if this was recognised as a registration by port authorities as the body is not internationally recognised as a country.
</p>
<p>
 The vessel was registered in the Netherlands in 2008.
