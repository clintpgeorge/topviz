<h2>
 Background
</h2>
<p>
 Throughout the 19th century South Georgia had first been a sealers' base and, in the following century, became a whalers' base. Prince Olav Harbour was the site of one of the seven main whaling bases established on South Georgia. Prince Olav Harbour was the location of a former Norwegian whaling station operational dating from 1911. The whaling station was initially a floating factory site, a shore station being set up in 1916. The whaling station continued as a shore station until March 1931 and then was closed. The name was in use as early as 1912 and was given by Norwegian whalers for Crown Prince Olav of Norway.
