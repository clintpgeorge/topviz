 Wreck
</h2>
<p>
 On the night of February 11, 1823—while sailing west through the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands with another whaling ship,
 <i>
  Martha
 </i>
 —the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 found herself in a storm. The two ships became separated and Captain Pollard of the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 was unclear as to his ship's position. Soon, the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 grounded and sank on a reef near French Frigate Shoals. Captain Pollard did not want to abandon ship but his crew pleaded with him and they clung to small boats through the night. The next morning, they were rescued by the crew of the
 <i>
  Martha
 </i>
 .

 The wreck was described by Thomas Nickerson who served as boatsteerer on the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 . Nickerson had also served with Pollard on the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 and survived its sinking. Nickerson's account is preserved in a manuscript titled "Loss of the Ship
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 of Nantucket" (MS 106 F3.5) in the collections of the Nantucket Historical Association.

 Discovery
</h2>
<p>
 The wreck of the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 was discovered in 2008 by a team of marine archaeologists working on an expedition for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The identity of the ship was not immediately known so it was called the "Shark Island Whaler"; the ship's identification as the
 <i>
  Two Brothers
 </i>
 was announced by NOAA on February 11, 2011, the 188th anniversary of her sinking. The wreck is the first discovery of a wrecked Nantucket whaling ship.

<p>
 Some of the first artifacts found at the wreck site include two anchors, three try pots, bricks, and the remains of the ship's rigging. Expeditions in 2009 and 2010 turned up more artifacts including blubber hooks, five harpoon tips, three whaling lances, four cast-iron cooking pots and ceramics and glass.
