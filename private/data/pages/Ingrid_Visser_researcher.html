<h2>
 Early life
</h2>
<p>
 Both her parents were Dutch immigrants who came to New Zealand in the 1950s. They were both nationalized as New Zealanders after she was born. Her mother is deceased and her father resides in New Zealand. She has one younger sister (Monique) also born in New Zealand, currently residing in Auckland, New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
 Between June 1982 and November 1986 Visser sailed with her parents and sister aboard a 17.3 m (57 ft) yacht, around the world. The trip covered over 50,000 nautical miles (93,000 km) and visited more than 40 countries.

<h2>
 Education
</h2>
<p>
 Visser holds three University Degrees; Bachelor of Science (Massey University), Masters of Science (Auckland University) and Doctorate of Philosophy (Auckland University). Visser has been working with orca (Orcinus orca) (also known as killer whales) since 1992 and completed her PhD in 2000, on the first ever scientific study of orca in New Zealand waters.
</p>

<h2>
 Scientific work
</h2>
<p>
 Her research on orca has been published in international scientific journals, since 1998, and many of these publications are available on the website Orca research. (see below for a list of scientific publications).
</p>
<p>
 In 2002 Visser’s research was instrumental in the New Zealand Government’s reclassification of New Zealand orca from “Common” in the New Zealand Threat Classification System to “Nationally Critical”. This is the equivalent status of “Critically Endangered” in the internationally recognised IUCN Red Data listing.

<h2>
 Publications
</h2>
<p>
 She has published numerous popular-style articles and her photographs have appeared in various magazines such as
 <i>
  National Geographic
 </i>
 , BBC Wildlife, New Zealand Geographic, and An Encyclopedia of New Zealand  .
</p>
<p>
 Visser has set up the Orca Research Trust, the Antarctic Killer Whale Identification Catalogue and was a co-founder of the Punta Norte Orca Research non-profit organisations all focusing on orca research. She also set up Adopt an Orca to facilitate fund raising and public awareness.
</p>
<p>
 Visser has written an autobiography (“Swimming with Orca” – a finalist in the Environmental category of the prestigious New Zealand Montana Book Awards) and two children’s books (“I love killer whales” &amp; “The Orca”). The latter has been translated into Māori and is currently in press as a bilingual English/Spanish publication.
</p>
<p>
 Visser works as a guide on a variety of eco-tourism adventures, from swimming with whales to visiting Antarctica. She is a public speaker and has been described as “a marine version of Jane Goodall,” where her passion for the protection of orcas and their fragile habitats, as well as rescuing many stranded whales are clearly illustrated in her photographs.

<h2>
 Other work
</h2>
<p>
 She is a member of the Australia &amp; New Zealand branch of The Explorers Club and continues to travel the world in search of orca. She has published the first ever manuscript on Papua New Guinea orca and returns regularly to Walindi Plantation Resort to conduct field research there.
</p>
<p>
 Ingrid is also playing a crucial role in the Free Morgan Foundation efforts to free the captive orca Morgan, and has appeared in court in the Netherlands in connection with Morgan’s release efforts.
</p>
<p>
 In September 2010 she co-founded Whale Rescue an organisation of extremely experienced and dedicated volunteers who provide logistical and practical expertise and equipment for rescuing cetaceans.
