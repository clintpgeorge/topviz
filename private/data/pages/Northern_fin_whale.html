 The
 <b>
  northern fin whale
 </b>
 (
 <i>
  Balaenoptera physalus physalus
 </i>
 ) is a subspecies of fin whale that lives in the North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean. It is possible that the population in each ocean represents a separate subspecies. At least one other subspecies of fin whale, the southern fin whale (
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 ), exists in the southern hemisphere.

 Size
</h2>
<p>
 Northern fin whales are smaller than their southern hemisphere counterparts, with adult males averaging 18.5 m (61 ft) and adult females 20 m (66 ft). Maximum reported figures are 22.9 m (75 ft) for males and 24.7 m (81 ft) for females in the North Pacific, while the longest reliably measured were 20.8 m (68 ft) and 22.9 m (75 ft) — all were caught off California, the former in the 1920s and the latter in the 1960s. At sexual maturity, males average 16.8–17.6 m (55–58 ft) in the North Atlantic and 17.4–17.7 m (57–58 ft) in the North Pacific, while females average 17.7–19.1 m (58–63 ft) in the North Atlantic and 18.3–18.6 m (60–61 ft) in the North Pacific. At birth, calves are 6.4 m (21 ft) in the North Pacific.

<h2>
 Reproduction
</h2>
<p>
 Because of the opposing seasons in each hemisphere,
 <i>
  B. p. physalus
 </i>
 breeds at a different time of the year than
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 . Peak conception for
 <i>
  B. p. physalus
 </i>
 is December-January, while peak birthing is in November-December — in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.
