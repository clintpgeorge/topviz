   Moby Dick—Rehearsed
  </b>
 </i>
 is a two-act drama by Orson Welles. The play was staged June 16–July 9, 1955, at the Duke of York's Theatre in London, in a production directed by Welles. The original cast included Welles, Gordon Jackson, Patrick McGoohan and Joan Plowright. The play was published by Samuel French in 1965.

 Welles used minimal stage design. The stage was bare, the actors appeared in contemporary street clothes, and the props were minimal. For example, brooms were used for oars, and a stick was used for a telescope. The actors provided the action, and the audience's imagination provided the ocean, costumes, and the whale.

 Welles filmed approximately 75 minutes of the production, with the original cast, at the Hackney Empire and Scala Theatres in London. He hoped to sell the film to
 <i>
  Omnibus
 </i>
 , the United States television series which had presented his live performance of
 <i>
  King Lear
 </i>
 in 1953; but Welles stopped shooting when he was disappointed in the results. The film is lost.

<h2>
 Plot
</h2>
<p>
 The setting is a mid-19th century American repertory theater. The play begins subtly as the audience arrives with the cast milling around an empty stage. The cast members generally fool around and complain about their boss and their forthcoming production of
 <i>
  King Lear
 </i>
 . Then, making a big dramatic entrance and smoking a cigar, the actor manager of the time comes on stage and tells them they are going to rehearse another piece, Moby Dick.
</p>
<p>
 The cast grudgingly performs the play, improvising scenery from items lying around, and gradually get more into character as the play develops.

 Because the film is lost, many people have speculated it was never created. However, evidence supporting the film was made can be found in the book,
 <i>
  The Films Of Christopher Lee
 </i>
 , by Pohle Jr. and Hart — Patrick McGoohan said in a 1986 interview that the excerpt of the film he saw while Welles was reviewing the rushes one day was fantastic.
</p>
<p>
 In
 <i>
  The Fabulous Orson Welles
 </i>
 , by Peter Noble, cameraman Hilton Craig reveals, "it was by no means merely a photographed stage-play. On the contrary, it was shot largely in close-ups and looked very impressive on near-completion."
</p>
<p>
 Kenneth Williams' autobiography
 <i>
  Just Williams
 </i>
 records Williams' apprehension at the project, as it was filmed by the play's cast in just one weekend at the then-abandoned Hackney Empire theatre. He describes how Welles' dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable. At least forty minutes of the play was filmed, but is now presumed lost.
</p>

 Of the film project, Welles's official biographer Barbara Leaming wrote in 1985:
</p>

    Persistent rumours over the years have hinted that there is a finished film of Welles's
    <i>
     Moby Dick
    </i>
    [
    <i>
     —Rehearsed
    </i>
    ] stashed away somewhere, but Orson had barely started the film when he gave it up. "We shot for three days", he recalls, "and it was obvious it wasn't going to be any good, so we stopped. There was no film made at all. We only did one and a half scenes. I said, let's not go on and waste our money, because it's not going to be any good."

<p>
 In support of this, Leaming quotes Welles's friend at the time, the playwright Wolf Mankowitz, who said, "Orson's attitude is a very pragmatic one. He thinks until you get on the set with the actors and lights and the rest of it, you don't know whether it's going to work or not. And he simply reserves the right as an artist to sort of drop it if it doesn't work."

<p>
 The

 film is not to be confused with a later unfinished film project in 1971, wherein Welles filmed 22 minutes of various scenes from the play, playing all the parts himself. The footage of that film was acquired by the Munich Film Museum in 1995 and restored in 1999.
