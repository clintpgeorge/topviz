<h2>
 Discovery
</h2>
<p>
 In November 2008, fossil remains of
 <i>
  Livyatan melvillei
 </i>
 were discovered in the sediments of Pisco formation at Cerro Colorado, 35 kilometres (22 mi) south-southwest of Ica, Peru. The remains include a partially preserved skull with teeth and mandible. Rotterdam Natural History Museum researcher Klaas Post stumbled across them on the final day of a field trip there in November 2008. Post was part of an international team of researchers, led by Dr Christian de Muizon, director of the Natural History Museum in Paris, and included other palaeontologists from Utrecht University and the natural history museums of Rotterdam, Museo storia naturale di Pisa, the Museum of Natural History of the National University of San Marcos in Lima and Brussels.
</p>
<p>
 The fossils have been dated at 12–13 million years old and were prepared in Lima, Peru, and are now part of the collection of the Natural History Museum there.

<h2>
 Etymology and nomenclature
</h2>
<p>
 Researchers originally assigned the English name of the biblical monster, Leviathan, to this prehistoric whale as
 <i>
  Leviathan melvillei
 </i>
 , dedicating the discovery to Herman Melville, author of
 <i>
  Moby-Dick
 </i>
 —the researchers behind the excavation of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 were all fans of this novel. However, the scientific name
 <i>
  Leviathan
 </i>
 was a junior homonym of
 <i>
  Leviathan
 </i>
 Koch, 1841 for a genus of mastodon (see
 <i>
  Leviathan
 </i>
 in Wikispecies). Junior homonyms need to be replaced with new names, except under certain special circumstances (ICZN 1999 Article 60). In August 2010, the authors rectified this situation by coining a new genus name for the whale,
 <i>
  Livyatan
 </i>
 , from the original Hebrew spelling.

<h2>
 Morphology and habitat
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Livyatan melvillei
 </i>
 was 13.5 to 17.5 metres (44–57 ft) long, about the same as a modern adult male sperm whale. The skull of
 <i>
  Livyatan melvillei
 </i>
 is 3 metres (10 ft) long. Unlike the modern sperm whale,
 <i>
  Physeter macrocephalus
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 had functional teeth in both its jaws. The jaws of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 were robust and its temporal fossa was also considerably larger than in the modern-age sperm whale.
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 is one of the largest predators yet known, with whale experts using the phrase "the biggest tetrapod bite ever found" to explain their find. The teeth of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 are up to 36 centimetres (1.18 ft) long and are thought to be the largest of any animal yet known. Larger 'teeth' (tusks) are known, such as walrus and elephant tusks, but these are not used directly in eating.
</p>
<h3>
 Skull structure
</h3>
<p>
 The fossil skull of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 has a curved basin which suggests it might have had a large spermaceti organ, a series of oil and wax reservoirs separated by connective tissue. This organ is thought to help modern sperm whales to dive deeply to feed. However,
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 is likely to have hunted large prey near the surface, so it appears that this organ would have had other functions. Possible suggestions include echolocation, acoustic displays (with the spermaceti organ acting as a resonance chamber) or aggressive headbutting, possibly used against competing males in mating contests or to batter prey.

<h2>
 Diet
</h2>
<p>
 Fossil remains of many other animals—including baleen whales, beaked whales, dolphins, porpoises, sharks, sea turtles, seals and sea birds—have been found at the same site where the remains of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 have been excavated.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 would have been a top predator of its time along with the giant shark,
 <i>
  C. megalodon
 </i>
 , which was contemporaneous with
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 in the same region, and the whale probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. The appearance of gigantic raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with a phase of diversification and size-range increase of the baleen-bearing mysticetes in the Miocene.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 is likely to have preyed upon 7–10-metre (23–33 ft) baleen whales, seals and dolphins.

<h2>
 Size estimation
</h2>
<p>
 Two physeterids have been chosen by whale experts for comparison to estimate the size of
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 . The anatomy of
 <i>
  Physeter macrocephalus
 </i>
 yielded a total length (TL) of 13.5 m (= 44.3 feet) for
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 , and that of
 <i>
  Zygophyseter varolai
 </i>
 yielded a TL of 17.5 m (= 57.5 feet) for
 <i>
  L. melvillei
 </i>
 .
