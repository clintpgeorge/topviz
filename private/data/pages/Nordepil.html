 History
</h2>
<p>
 Norðdepil was founded in 1866. Its school opened in 1895. From 1897 to 1912 a whaling station was located in the community, built by Norwegians. The first owners were
 <i>
  Andorsen &amp; Neumann
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Norðdepil has been connected with the town of Hvannasund on Viðoy by a road on a dam since 1963. Because the two communities are located directly across from each other on opposite shores, they often act as one community.
 <br/>
 Since 1967, two single-lane tunnels have connected Norðdepil with the regional city of Klaksvík.
</p>
<p>
 Immediately bordering Norðdepil to its north is the abandoned settlement Fossá, of which nothing remains. Fossá was named after some waterfalls.
 <br/>
 Further north on the east coast of Borðoy there is a road going from Norðdepil to the hamlet Múli.
