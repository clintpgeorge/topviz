 Early history
</h2>
<p>
 The first European to sight the bay was explorer Abel Tasman, who sought to anchor his vessel
 <i>
  Heemskerck
 </i>
 there in 1642. Instead,
 <i>
  Heemskerck
 </i>
 was driven back offshore by a storm, in token of which Tasman named the place
 <b>
  Storm Bay
 </b>
 .

 Captain Tobias Furneaux renamed it in honour of his ship HMS
 <i>
  Adventure
 </i>
 in March 1773, which he had anchored in the bay for five days after becoming separated from Captain James Cook's HMS
 <i>
  Resolution
 </i>
 during Cook's second voyage to the Pacific search of Terra Australis Incognita.
</p>
<p>
 Furneaux's log made clear the bay was an excellent anchorage for resupplying vessels:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  To the SW of the first watering place there is a large lagoon which I believe has plenty of fish in it for one of our Gentlemen caught upwards of 2 dozen trout, and shot a possum which was the only animal we saw. There are a great many gum trees and of a vast thickness and height, one of which measured in circumference 26 feet and the height under the branches was 20 feet."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Others among Furneaux's crew spotted evidence of what they believed were small deer but were more likely kangaroos. Furneaux also noted signs of an Aboriginal settlement in the form of "several huts or wigwams on shore, with several bags of grass in which they carry their shellfish." - but the branches of which the huts were made were "split and torn" and there was "not the least appearance of any people."
</p>
<p>
 Reliably mapped and offering an abundance of water, fresh water and game, Adventure Bay quickly became a popular anchorage for European explorers. Cook's
 <i>
  Resolution
 </i>
 watered there in 1777, followed by William Bligh aboard HMS
 <i>
  Bounty
 </i>
 in 1788 and HMS
 <i>
  Providence
 </i>
 in 1792. Others who resupplied their vessels in the bay in this period included Bruni d'Entrecasteaux aboard
 <i>
  Recherché
 </i>
 in 1792 and 1792, and Nicolas Baudin in the corvette
 <i>
  Géographe
 </i>
 in 1802. Matthew Flinders also tried to enter the bay with
 <i>
  Norfolk
 </i>
 in 1798.

 European Settlement
</h2>
<p>
 In the later nineteenth century Adventure Bay became the site of a whaling station, and during the 19th and 20th century it was used by the timber industry. Sheltered from all but strong north-easterly winds, the township of Adventure Bay at the southern end of the bay itself was the site of both extensive timber mills and a long jetty from where seagoing vessels could load timber. Dangerously exposed to north-easterly gales, several ships were driven ashore and wrecked there, the largest being the 241-ton barque
 <i>
  Natal Queen
 </i>
 in 1909.
</p>
<p>
 Adventure Bay Post Office opened on 1 December 1890 and closed in 1974. Adventure Bay is now largely a tourist destination.
