</h2>
<p>
 Doorly dictated
 <i>
  The Songs of the Morning
 </i>
 . This was a compilation of songs written during the voyages. In most cases, the words were written by one of the officers and were put to music by Doorly. It was published by the Melbourne Wine and Cheese Club in 1943. Two linking narratives are extant.
</p>
<p>
 In 2002, a recording entitled
 <i>
  The Songs of the Morning: a Musical Sketch
 </i>
 was published. This is a mixture of songs, poems and narrative, mostly related to the voyage from London to Lyttelton and the first voyage to the Antarctic. Royalties from the recording are split between the Dundee Heritage Trust's Antarctica 100 Discovery Restoration Fund and the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust.
