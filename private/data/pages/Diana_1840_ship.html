 was a whaling ship built in 1840, in Bremen, Germany. She sailed out of Hull, England. In 1858 a steam engine was installed, making her the first steam-powered whaler to sail from Hull (
 <i>
  Tay

 from Dundee was the first ever, a year earlier).

 Trapped in the ice
</h2>
<p>
 In 1866, while on a whaling expedition in Baffin Bay,
 <i>
  Diana
 </i>
 became frozen in the ice, where it was trapped for over six months. The ship's captain, 64 year old John Gravill, and many of the crew died. The diary of the deeply devout ship's doctor, Charles Edward Smith, was published in the book
 <i>
  From the Deep of the Sea
 </i>
 . (ISBN 0-87021-932-4) There is a memorial fountain to
 <i>
  Diana'
 </i>
 s return from the ice in the city of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, as much of the crew was from there. Charles Smith's services and heroism were recognised by the award of a set of surgical instruments from the Board of Trade. Captain Gravill's body was taken back to Hull, and his funeral was attended by an estimated fifteen thousand people.

 Fate
</h2>
<p>
 In 1869, while making her way back from the Davis Strait,
 <i>
  Diana
 </i>
 encountered a strong gale, and was washed into the Donna Nook sands, on the Lincolnshire coast, and broke up.
 <i>
  Diana
 </i>
 was the last whaling ship from the port of Hull. Her loss ended the whaling industry of the city.
