 ) was a schooner skippered by Robert Bartlett that made many scientific expeditions to the Arctic, sponsored by American museums, the Explorers Club and the National Geographic Society. She also helped survey the Arctic for the United States Government during World War II. She is currently designated by the United States Department of the Interior as a National Historic Landmark as part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. She is the State Ship of Massachusetts.

 History
</h2>
<p>
 Designed by George McClain of Gloucester, Massachusetts to withstand North Atlantic gales,
 <i>
  Effie M. Morrissey
 </i>
 was the last fishing schooner built for the Wonson Fish Company. Built with white oak and yellow pine at the John F. James &amp; Washington Tarr shipyard, she took four months to build and was launched 1 February 1894. Her hull was painted black and her first skipper was William Edward Morrissey, who named her after his daughter Effie Maude Morrissey.

 fished out of Gloucester for eleven years. Considered a high liner, on her first voyage she brought in over 200,000 pounds (91,000 kg) of fish, enough to pay for her construction. One of
 <i>

 </i>
 's more notable skippers was Clayton Morrissey who went on to skipper the racing schooner Henry Ford. A statue to Clayton Morrissey by sculptor Leonard Craske entitled the Gloucester Fisherman's Memorial can be seen on Gloucester's Western Avenue.
</p>
<p>
 In 1905 under a new owner, Captain Ansel Snow,
 <i>
  Effie M. Morrissey
 </i>
 began fishing out of Digby, Nova Scotia. In 1912, the Montreal journalist and photographer Frederick William Wallace sailed on the vessel as a member of Snow's crew. His epic poem about his time aboard
 <i>
  Effie M. Morrissey
 </i>
 , "The Log of the Record Run," was widely read and adopted by east coast fishermen with such authentic results that it was mistaken as a very old traditional song by folklorist Helen Creighton.
</p>
<p>
 Then in 1914, ownership moved to Brigus, Newfoundland where Harold Bartlett used her as a fishing and coasting vessel along the Newfoundland and Labrador shoreline.
</p>
<h3>
 Early 20th century: exploration
</h3>
<p>
 In 1925 Harold Bartlett sold her to his cousin, noted Arctic explorer Capt. Bob Bartlett, who installed an auxiliary engine and reinforced the hull so the vessel could be used in Arctic ice. In 1926 with the financial support of the well known publisher George Palmer Putnam, Bartlett embarked on two decades of Arctic exploration using this vessel.

 Mid 20th century: packet ship
 <i>
  Ernestina
 </i>
</h3>
<p>
 When Captain Robert Bartlett died on April 28, 1946,
 <i>
  Effie M. Morrissey
 </i>
 was sold to the Jackson brothers to carry mail and passengers in an inter-island trade in the South Pacific. On their voyage to the Pacific she developed problems at sea, forcing the crew to return to New York City. On December 2, 1947, the boat caught fire of undetermined origin while docked at the Boat Basin in Flushing, New York.
</p>
<p>
 The schooner was repaired and sold to Louisa Mendes of Egypt, Massachusetts. She entered the packet trade in a trans-Atlantic crossing to Cape Verde with a cargo of food and clothing. Upon reaching the islands, Captain Henrique Mendes reregistered the schooner under the name
 <i>
  Ernestina
 </i>
 , after his own daughter, and used her in inter-island trade.
 <i>
  Ernestina
 </i>
 made many transatlantic voyages and fell into disrepair at Cape Verde, where she remained until the late nineteen sixties when interest arose in the United States to save the historic vessel. Harry Dugan and the Bartlett Exploration Association of Philadelphia made several offers to buy the ship for the South Street Seaport Museum in New York. In 1977 the people of Cape Verde agreed to give
 <i>
  Ernestina
 </i>
 to the people of the United States. The Foreign Minister, speaking on behalf of President Aristides Pereira said:
</p>
<dl>
 <dd>
  "The Government of Cape Verde offers the
  <i>
   Ernestina
  </i>
  as a gift to the United States of America as an expression of the high regard of the people of Cape Verde for the people of the United States and we deliver the vessel to the State of Massachusetts as a representative of the people of the United States."
 </dd>
</dl>
<h3>
 Late 20th century: National Historic Landmark
</h3>
<p>
 In August 1982 her hull was completely rebuilt and she sailed to the United States with a crew of Cape Verdeans and Americans.
</p>
<p>
 In August 1988 the schooner made a return trip to Brigus, Newfoundland, home of Capt. Bob Bartlett on the 113th anniversary of his birth.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Ernestina
 </i>
 was designated by the United States Department of the Interior as a National Historic Landmark in 1990, with restoration being completed in 1994, and in 1996 became a part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. She is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  Built in 1894, the schooner ERNESTINA is the oldest surviving Grand Banks fishing schooner; the only surviving 19th century Gloucester-built fishing schooner; one of two remaining examples of the Fredonia-style schooners (the other being LETTIE G. HOWARD, also a National Historic Landmark), the most famous American fishing vessel type; the only offshore example of that type; and one of two sailing Arctic exploration vessels left afloat in the United States (the other being BOWDOIN, also a National Historic Landmark). Today, ERNESTINA regularly sails the New England coast on educational cruises.
