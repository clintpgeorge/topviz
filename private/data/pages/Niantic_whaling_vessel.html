 was a whaleship that brought fortune-seekers to Yerba Buena later renamed San Francisco during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Run aground and converted into a storeship and hotel, she was a prominent landmark in the booming city for several years. The site of
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 beside the Transamerica Pyramid is now a California Historical Landmark. Artifacts excavated in 1978 and the ship's log from her last voyage are on display in the San Francisco Maritime Museum.

 Early years

<p>
 1832—
 <i>
  Niantic

 built in Connecticut. Originally intended for trade with China, she was later converted to a sperm whaler. Owners in 1840 appear to have been N. L. and G. Griswold of New York.
</p>
<p>
 1840—
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 , Captain Doty in command (Captain Robert Bennett Forbes acting), sailed with tea and silk from Port of Canton to an unstated destination (perhaps New York) via Anjer (Anyer), Indonesia, just missing a blockade by the British in Canton as part of the First Opium War. "Probably this was the last and most profitable voyage of
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 as a merchant ship."
</p>
<p>
 The China trade painting of
 <i>

 at right shows her at the Whampoa anchorage near Canton. Although the date is unknown, 1840 seems likely.

 Peru, Panama, and the race to California, 1849
</h2>
<p>
 After rounding Cape Horn in January 1849,
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 put into Paita (Payta), Peru on March 8, and received a letter there from the American consul in Panama requesting them to carry passengers from Panama to San Francisco. Large numbers of people (in some accounts referred to as Argonauts) had crossed the Isthmus of Panama and were waiting on the Pacific coast for transportation to California; the gold rush had begun. The vessel was immediately modified to carry passengers above and below the weather deck. They departed Paita for Panama on 25 March taking 150 mules, barrels of potatoes, a large amount of lumber, and other supplies.
</p>
<p>
 Arriving on the Panama coast April 8,
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 spent nearly four weeks in preparations. She departed for San Francisco May 2 with 246 passengers; 20 are reported to have been accommodated in the captain's cabin alone. Sixteen passengers paid $250 each, and the remaining paid $150, or an unrecorded amount. Thus, the total passenger fees probably amounted to $38,500. One slave was included among the passengers. Two passengers died en route.
</p>
<p>
 Experience whaling in the Pacific and familiarity with its winds gave Cleaveland an advantage over other ships in the race to San Francisco; for 28 days he headed generally southwest, against the vocal objections of dismayed passengers, before catching the southeast trade winds beginning May 24, and finally turning northwest May 30.
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 was thus one of the first ships to bring gold seekers to San Francisco, arriving at 11 pm July 5, 1849.
</p>

<h2>
 Storeship and hotel
</h2>
<p>
 In San Francisco harbor, most of the crew deserted to join the gold rush.
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 's log records that five of the crew deserted the first day, nine the second day, three more deserted the fourth day and two were arrested by the US Sloop of War USS
 <i>
  Warren
 </i>
 for assaulting Captain Cleaveland with a knife, and five were released the sixth day (including one released by
 <i>
  Warren
 </i>
 ). This may have left a crew as small as five to finish unloading the ship.
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 's log ends the next day, 12 July 1849.

 Without a crew to sail, and with more ships arriving daily,
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 's officers were instructed by her owners, probably through an agent in San Francisco, to sell the vessel. With the aid of her empty whale oil barrels tied to her hull for extra buoyancy, the ship was floated on a high tide into shallow water, just offshore from the intersection of Clay and Montgomery Streets. Now hard aground,
 <i>
  Niantic
 </i>
 was converted for use variously as a warehouse, store, offices, and hotel.
</p>
<p>
 "Over the gaping wound in her stout oaken side, where a doorway was cut for a public entrance, was inscribed the hospitable legend, 'Rest for the weary and storage for trunks.'"
</p>
<p>
 Access was first by a pier or footbridge, but later, the sandy bluffs along Montgomery Street were flattened and the shallows around the ship were filled.

 The Cleavelands appear to have purchased the smaller vessel
 <i>

 , and were able to sail out of San Francisco with a crew of just six.

 Fires, 1850-1852
</h2>
<p>
 The converted vessel burned repeatedly in the fires that devastated the new city of San Francisco over the next several years, but was repeatedly rebuilt as the Niantic Hotel, looking less like a ship each time. The Niantic Hotel was described in about 1852 as the finest hotel in San Francisco.

 's hull was rediscovered when the old Niantic Hotel was demolished in 1872. Thirty-five baskets of champagne were found in the ruins.

<p>
 In 1907,
 <i>

 was again discovered during rebuilding from the San Francisco Fire of 1906. A new Niantic Building was constructed.

 A plaque was placed at 505 Sansome at Clay by the Historic Landmarks Committee of the Native Sons of the Golden West, on September 19, 1919.

 Excavation, 1978

<p>
 <i>

 was rediscovered once again in 1978 during excavation for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex next to the Transamerica Pyramid, now about six blocks from the waterfront. Excavations were hurried, and there was little time for preservation or study.
</p>
<p>
 One last basket of intact bottles of champagne was found deep in the charred remnants of the hull. One of these bottles was later given to Dionis Coffin Riggs, the great granddaughter of Captain Cleaveland, in appreciation for donating the ship's log to investigators.

The display includes the ship's log kept by First Mate James Cleaveland, recording the arrival in San Francisco.
