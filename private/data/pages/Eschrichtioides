Eschrichtioides is an extinct genus of eschrichtiid from the early Pliocene of northern Italy. Its type species, E. gastaldii, had a superfluous taxonomic history, starting as a cetothere, then as an extinct balaenopterid, before being finally recognized as a relative of the gray whale.

Distribution
Eschrichtioides is one of two eschrichtiids known from the Neogene of Italy, the other being Archaeschrichtius . Its holotype, MRSN 13802 , comes from the early Pliocene-age Sabbie d'Asti Formation of the Piedmont region in Italy.

Classification
Like other thalassotheres from the Italian Pliocene, the classification of Eschrichtioides was highly contentious. It was originally misidentified as the balaenopterid "Balaena" cortesii ,(who regarded "B." cortesii as a species of Cetotherium ) but later described as a new species of Cetotherium , C. gastaldii . However, several authors considered it to be referrable to Balaenoptera , a taxonomic arrangement which was accepted for more than a century. However, re-examination of MRSN 13802 revealed that "C." gastaldii was not a balaenopterid and instead constituted its own genus within Eschrichtiidae.
