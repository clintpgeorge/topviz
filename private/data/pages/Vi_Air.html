 Whaling station
</h2>
<p>
 There used to be a working whaling station at Við Áir. It was built in 1905 by Norwegians; later it was run by Faroese people. It was abandoned in 1984, when they stopped the work there. The buildings from the whaling station are still there, and the machinery is still there too. The buildings were in bad shape, but in 2011 some restoration work was done. There are plans to restore the whaling station back to the way it was, and make it into a maritime museum, where people can visit it and get an idea of how the whaling station functioned. In the autumn of 2011 the whaling station was open for the public, and around 500 people visited the buildings. In 2007, a group of people who were chosen by the Faroese government delivered a "Provisional report on the conservation of the whaling station as a maritime museum", which is available in English too.

<h2>
 School
</h2>
<p>
 There is a school at Við Áir. The school is called Dugni; it is for young people and adults who have a disability, have psychological or sociological problems. They can get a shorter education there, 9th or 10th degree from the public school or the Danish education which is called HFS, which prepares them for an education in the service industry or working in an office. The students can live on the school while they attend the school; they can also live elsewhere.
