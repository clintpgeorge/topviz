 During Colonial times Betty's Bay was a favourite place for runaway slaves, but in 1912 Betty's Bay became a formal whaling station running up until the 1930s. Remains of the whaling station can still be seen at Stony Point. The area is named after Betty Youlden, daughter of the first developer of the area.
