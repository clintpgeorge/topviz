   Make Mine Music
  </b>
 </i>
 is an 1946 American animated anthology film produced by Walt Disney and released to theatres on April 20, 1946. It is the 8th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series.
</p>
<p>
 During the Second World War, much of Walt Disney's staff was drafted into the army, and those that remained were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the feature film division alive during this difficult time, the studio released six package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music. This is the third package film, following
 <i>
  Saludos Amigos
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  The Three Caballeros
 </i>
 . It received mixed to positive reviews, though its first segment,
 <i>
  The Martins and the Coys
 </i>
 , was panned by critics due to its overuse of violence.
</p>
<p>
 The musical director was Al Sack.
</p>
<p>
 The film was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.

 Film segments

 <i>
  The Martins and the Coys
 </i>
</h3>
<p>
 This segment featured popular radio vocal group, King's Men singing the story of a Hatfields and McCoys-style feud in the mountains broken up when two young people from each side fell in love. It was edited out in the NTSC home media version because it had parts too intense for children, while in the PAL version, it was kept.
</p>
<h3>
 <i>
  Blue Bayou
 </i>
</h3>
<p>
 This segment featured animation originally intended for
 <i>
  Fantasia
 </i>
 using the Claude Debussy musical composition
 <i>
  Clair de Lune
 </i>
 from Suite bergamasque. It featured two egrets flying through the Everglades on a moonlit night. However, by the time
 <i>
  Make Mine Music
 </i>
 was released
 <i>
  Clair de Lune
 </i>
 was replaced by the new song

  Blue Bayou
 </i>
 , performed by the Ken Darby Singers. However, the original version of the segment still survives.

 This segment was one of two segments to which Benny Goodman contributed: an innovative shot in which a pencil drew the action as it was happening, and in which 1940s teens were swept away by popular music.

<h3>
 <i>
  The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met
 </i>
</h3>
<p>
 The bittersweet finale about a Sperm Whale with incredible musical talent and his dreams of singing Grand Opera. A legend is spread throughout the city that there is an opera-singing whale, but as it is seemingly disproven, it is assumed that the whale has swallowed an opera singer who is the one the sailors are actually hearing sing. The short-sighted impresario Tetti-Tatti believes this and sets out to destroy Willy, the newspapers announcing that he was going to see. Whitey, Willy's seagull friend, excitedly brings Willy the newspaper, all of his friends believing that this is his big chance, so he goes out to meet the boat and sing for Tetti-Tatti. He finds them, and upon hearing Willy sing, Tetti-Tatti comes to believe that Willy has swallowed not one, but THREE singers (due to his having three uvulae), and chases him with a harpoon on a boat with three crewmen. Upon hearing the whale sing, the crewmen try to stop Tetti-Tatti from killing the whale, as they want to continue listening to him sing, even to the point of tying up Tetti-Tatti and sitting on him, however he still manages to escape and fire the harpoon gun. In the end, Willie was harpooned and killed, but the narrator then explains that Willy's voice will sing on in Heaven. Nelson Eddy narrated and performed all the voices in this segment. As Willie the Whale, Eddy sang all three male voices in the first part of the Sextet from Donizetti's opera, Lucia di Lammermoor.
