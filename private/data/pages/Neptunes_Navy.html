 Past
</h3>
<p>
 The group has historically operated a number of vessels. The
 <i>
  Ocean Warrior
 </i>
 , later renamed the RV
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was purchased in 1996 but seized by the Canadian government in April 2008. Due to the age of the vessel, the Society has decided not to pursue any avenue of reacquiring it. Paul Watson in fact stated that they had intentionally utilised a vessel that had become too old for Sea Shepherd to keep in action further.
</p>
<p>
 In June 2009 Sea Shepherd announced that the trimaran
 <i>
  Earthrace
 </i>
 , later renamed
 <i>
  Ady Gil
 </i>
 , would accompany its 2009-10 operations against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Pete Bethune, the operator of the vessel, said that an agreement was reached with Sea Shepherd for the boat to adopt a support role. On October 17, 2009, the Earthrace was presented to the media with a new black paint job, and renamed
 <i>
  Ady Gil
 </i>
 , after the name of a major sponsor. On January 6, 2010 the vessel was badly damaged in a collision at sea with the Japanese vessel
 <i>
  Shōnan Maru 2
 </i>
 . The
 <i>
  Ady Gil
 </i>
 sank on January 8 while she was being towed towards the French Dumont d'Urville Station in Antarctica after it filled with water and became too heavy to tow. The financial loss was estimated at about $1.5 million.

<h3>
 Current (2013)
</h3>
<p>
 As of 2013, the conservation society operates four ships, the MY
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 , MV
 <i>
  Brigitte Bardot
 </i>
 , the MY
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 and the MY
 <i>
  Sam Simon
 </i>
 . The
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 was obtained in 2006 and originally called the
 <i>
  Robert Hunter
 </i>
 . It was renamed in honor of Australian Steve Irwin ("The Crocodile Hunter"). Terri Irwin, his widow, gave her support to Sea Shepherd, saying, "Whales have always been in Steve's heart and in 2006 he was investigating the possibility of joining the Sea Shepherd on part of its journey to defend these beautiful animals."
</p>
<p>
 The other ship, the 1200-tonne
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 , was named after famous television game-show host and animal activist Bob Barker, who made the purchase of the retired Norwegian whaling vessel possible with a donation of US$5 million. This ship and the
 <i>
  Irwin
 </i>
 were both given new dazzle paint jobs in 2011. They are easier to tell apart now since the
 <i>
  Irwin
 </i>
 has a 77 painted on its bow and the
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 has the old "cartoon shark mouth" design on its bow.
</p>
<p>
 Sea Shepherd acquired the
 <i>
  Ocean 7 Adventurer
 </i>
 for its 2011 campaign against Japanese whaling in the Antarctic, renaming it MV
 <i>
  Gojira
 </i>
 . However, after a legal claim, Sea Shepherd have renamed the MV
 <i>
  Gojira
 </i>
 and the vessel is now known as MV
 <i>
  Brigitte Bardot
 </i>
 . On December 29, 2011 the vessel was damaged by a 6 m (20 ft) rogue wave whilst pursuing the Japanese whaling fleet during Operation Divine Wind off the western cost of Australia. The main hull was cracked and the port side pontoon needed to be held together by straps. In response to this incident and new tactics employed by the Japanese whaling fleet, Paul Watson has stated that he intends to procure more vessels to prevent themselves being outnumbered and shorthanded in future engagements. To this end, Sea Shepherd acquired the 56 m (184 ft) long MY
 <i>
  Sam Simon
 </i>
 in June 2012, the vessel being named after the co-creator of
 <i>
  The Simpsons
 </i>
 who made a sizable donation to finance the vessel's purchase.
 <i>
  Sam Simon
 </i>
 was formerly operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency at the Maizuru Marine Laboratory under the name
 <i>
  Seifu Maru
 </i>
 .

 Other watercraft
</h2>
<p>
 The group has also operated smaller boats in its campaigns including jet skis, Delta RHIB and Zodiac inflatables deployed off of the larger vessels. In 1999 Sea Shepherd briefly obtained a small personal submarine in hopes of using it against tribal whalers. The sub however was never fully functional and Sea Shepherd decided to sell it instead for an undisclosed price.
</p>

<h2>
 Aircraft
</h2>
<p>
 In addition to their maritime assets, Sea Shepherd also operates several types of aircraft from their ships; these have included Sikorsky S-300 and MD 500 helicopters which typically are carried aboard the
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 , unmanned drones, and a microlight aircraft that was briefly used during their campaign in the Faroe Islands. The aircraft are used to conduct forward reconnaissance to search for targets beyond visual range, as well as to monitor operations once a target is acquired.

<h2>
 Registration concerns
</h2>
<p>
 The vessels being engaged in controversial activities has caused registration issues with multiple governments, and the ships of the fleet have flown the flags of several different nations.
</p>
<p>
 In August 2006, the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 had its registration revoked by Canada. Later that year, Japan requested that the United Kingdom strip the
 <i>
  Robert Hunter
 </i>
 of its flag and for Belize to strip the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 of hers. The
 <i>
  Robert Hunter
 </i>
 was removed from the shipping registers of the United Kingdom since its activities were "inconsistent with her status as a pleasure vessel." The International Merchant Marine Registry of Belize withdrew the use of the nation's flag after finding the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 was not being used as a pleasure craft and stated that "it could not condone acts that threatened life and property at sea." The Mohawk Traditional Council of Kahnawake offered support and flags of the Iroquois Confederacy to fly on the
 <i>
  Farley Mowat
 </i>
 and the
 <i>
  Robert Hunter
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In early 2010, the
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 briefly falsely flew a Norwegian flag with the intent to deceive Japanese whalers.
</p>
<p>
 The
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 now sails under the Dutch flag, but legislation was introduced to ban the group from using it. However, the junior transport minister later noted that there was no further intention of deregistering the
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 . In February 2010, however, after repeated requests by Japan, a new bill was introduced which would modify the registry law to allow ships to be struck from the registry if their conduct harmed the Netherlands' reputation.
</p>
<p>
 Also in February 2010, Japan announced that Togo had struck the
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 from its registry. The Bob Barker has since been re-registered in the Netherlands.
