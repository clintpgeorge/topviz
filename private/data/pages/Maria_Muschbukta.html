  Maria Muschbukta
 </b>
 (English:
 <i>
  Maria Musch Bay
 </i>
 ) is an open bay between Fulgeberget ("Bird Mountain") and Kvalrossen, on the western coast of the island of Jan Mayen. It is named after Maria Musch, widow of merchant and shipowner Jan Jacobsz. Musch. She was a member of the
 <i>
  Kleine Noordse Compagnie
 </i>
 , which sent a ship to Jan Mayen in 1616. This ship was the first to use the bay to hunt whales. The name is shown on Joan Blaeu's 1662 map of the island.
