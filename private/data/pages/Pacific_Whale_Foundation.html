  Pacific Whale Foundation
 </b>

 Since its foundation the PWF has been working to prevent destruction of populations of Humpback whales, dolphins, turtles and coral reefs in Hawaii. Every year the PWF organizes a "Great Whale Count" where volunteers systematically gather data on whales that can be seen from ten observation points along the southern shore of Maui, giving a series of snapshots that indicate changes in whale populations. The Pacific Whale Foundation provided funding to the Alfaguara project on Isla de Chilo√© in southern Chile for marine surveys of the local blue whale population in the 2012 season.
