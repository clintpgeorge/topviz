  <b>
   Moby Dick
  </b>
 </i>
 is a 1930 all-talking film made by Warner Bros., directed by Lloyd Bacon, and starring John Barrymore and Joan Bennett. The film is a sound remake of the 1926 silent movie,
 <i>
  The Sea Beast
 </i>
 , which also starred Barrymore.

 Plot
</h2>
<p>
 The film tells of a sea captain's maniacal quest for revenge on a great white whale who has bitten off his leg. Barrymore, as Ahab, meet and falls in love with Joan Bennett, daughter of the local minister, after disembarking in New Bedford. Bennett quickly falls in love with Barrymore and is heartbroken when he leaves on another voyage. During his next voyage, Barrymore loses his leg to a large white whale. When he returns to New Bedford, he mistakenly believes that Bennett no longer wants to see him because of his disfigurement. He vows revenge against the whale, and to kill it or be killed in the process, and returns to sea.

<h3>
 Differences from novel
</h3>
<p>
 The film, just as
 <i>
  The Sea Beast
 </i>
 (the previous 1926 silent version) was, is an extremely free adaptation of the novel
 <i>
  Moby-Dick
 </i>
 by Herman Melville. It implements a prequel and sequel element to the story that did not exist in Melville's novel, and Starbuck does not play the same function as in the novel. As an example of the changes found in the film, Captain Ahab is seen as a handsome, romantic hero with a pretty girlfriend and has both of his legs until he embarks on the voyage in which Moby Dick bites off one of them. After his evil brother manipulates the situation so that she will reject him, he becomes consumed with revenge embarks on the odyssey to kill the whale that maimed him. Ultimately, Ahab survives the ordeal, kills his stowaway brother (as well as Moby Dick), and returns home to the woman who loves him.

 The page that is shown on the screen as the first page of the novel is completely phony.
