 is the nickname given to a mysterious quacking-like sound which was first reported in the open ocean by submarines in the 1960s. It is recorded frequently around the coasts of Australia, and in particular in the Perth Canyon.

 The sounds were originally detected by sonar operators on Oberon class submarines. They are audible with frequencies from 50 to 300Â Hz. The duration of the calls are 1.6 and 3.1 seconds. The sounds occur many times per day from winter to October, and then tapers off till December. Then it is not heard till the next winter.

 In 2014, it was announced that the source of the sound had been identified as being vocalisations from the minke whale. Although the reason for the vocalisations remains a mystery, they appear to be produced near the surface before deep feeding dives. There are hopes that analysing the history, location, and frequency of the sounds will enable cetacean researchers to learn more about the life cycle of the minke.
