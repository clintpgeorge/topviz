Protororqualus is a genus of extinct rorqual from the late Pliocene (Piacenzian) of Mount Pulgnasco, Italy.

Classification
The type species, Protorqualus cuvierii , was originally described in 1829 as a species of Balaena ,but later transferred to the Belgian genus Plesiocetus . Following synonymy of Plesiocetus with Balaenoptera , B. cuvieri was considered a species of Balaenoptera ,  although some authors treated it as a species of Cetotherium . Later work, however, showed that the Mount Pulgnasco skeleton was generically distinct from other fossil and extant rorquals to warrant its own genus.
