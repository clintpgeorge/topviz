Rokovoko or Kokovoko is the fictional island home of the character Queequeg, as described in Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick.
Rokovoko is said to be "an island far away to the West and South" from New England. "It is not down in any map; true places never are," Melville writes. It was ruled by Queequeg's father, who is described as both high chief and king. Queequeg's uncle is the island's High Priest. Ishmael feared this island's inhabitants practiced cannibalism.
The spelling of the name differs in the initial English and American editions of the book.
