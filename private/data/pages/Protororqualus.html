<h2>
 Classification
</h2>
<p>
 The type species,
 <i>
  Protorqualus cuvierii
 </i>
 , was originally described in 1829 as a species of
 <i>
  Balaena
 </i>
 ,but later transferred to the Belgian genus
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 . Following synonymy of
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 with
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  B. cuvieri
 </i>
 was considered a species of
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 ,  although some authors treated it as a species of
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 . Later work, however, showed that the Mount Pulgnasco skeleton was generically distinct from other fossil and extant rorquals to warrant its own genus.
