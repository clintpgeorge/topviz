The Bake-kujira (化鯨?, literally "ghost whale") is a mythical Japanese yōkai (ghost, phantom, or strange apparition) from western Japan.
It is supposedly a large ghostly skeleton whale and is said to be accompanied by strange birds and fish. The Bake-kujira is 60 feet (18 m) long and is said to live on the Japanese coastline. It is said to have a very high aggression level.

Legends
In one story a fisherman tries to catch it with his harpoon but the harpoon sailed right through it and the Bake-kujira floated away. In other stories people say that the Bake-kujira brings a curse and general misfortune to the area where it is spotted.
