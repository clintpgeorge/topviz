 Career
</h2>
<p>
 As the TX 33
 <i>
  Maarten Cornelis
 </i>
 she was used to test the sumwing which caused less soil disturbance than traditional beam trawl because the wing hovers above the ground when fished. It also used less fuel than traditional trawling.

 In 2010 the ship was leased by the Golfo Azzurro Foundation who partnered with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and, using funds from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, used the ship for covert surveillance operations in the Danish Protectorate of the Faroe Islands.

<p>
 On August 17 the ship was boarded and searched by the Danish Police and then let go under escort by the Royal Danish Navy. Denmark's Thetis class frigate
 <i>
  Triton
 </i>
 was assigned to monitor their actions.
