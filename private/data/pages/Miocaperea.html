 Evolution and significance
</h2>
<p>
 The discovery of
 <i>
  Miocaperea
 </i>
 is significant because neobalaenids were previously unknown in the fossil record, except for an isolated petrosal (ear bone) from late Miocene-aged deposits in Australia. A previous study placed the divergence date of Neobalaenidae from other mysticetes at about 23 million years, and the age of
 <i>
  Miocaperea
 </i>
 lends credence to the notion of an origin for Neobalaenidae deep in the early Miocene.
