 Career

<p>
 After finishing middle school he spent six seasons as a whaler in the Southern Ocean. Whaling was the foremost business in his hometown Sandefjord. However, during World War I stock market speculation became more lucrative. Gleditsch tried his luck from 1916, but the market crashed in 1918. In 1920 he opened shop as a colourman and seller of ship equipment. In 1926 he saw an opportunity to manufacture the paint he sold, as he took over the factory Jotun from Johan Bryde. The factory had gone bankrupt in 1925, but was now resurrected under the name Jotun Kemiske Fabrik.

 In 1931 the product Arcanol was introduced, starting the upward trend for Jotun. The company opened a research laboratory in 1950, and expanded with factories in the Kingdom of Libya in 1962 and Thailand in 1967. In 1967 Odd Gleditsch, Jr. became CEO. Gleditsch Sr. continued as a board member until 1971. In 1972, through a merger, Jotun Kemiske Fabrik changed its name to Jotun.
