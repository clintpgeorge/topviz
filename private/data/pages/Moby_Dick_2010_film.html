 Plot
</h2>
<p>
 The film begins in November 20, 1969, 50 miles off Soviet waters. When the USS
 <i>
  Acushnet
 </i>
 dives under the ice, a young Ahab listens for enemy subs when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater.
</p>
<p>
 In the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (Renée O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale song generator when the USS
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Adam Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice.
</p>
<p>
 In San Diego, Captain Boomer (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 . He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.
</p>
<p>
 Meanwhile, the USS
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 is searching for the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 engages at what appears to be the sub they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the sub is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.
</p>
<p>
 A helicopter in search of the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 encounters it while the sub is following a 600-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the sub fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.
</p>
<p>
 The whale then attacks the S.S.
 <i>
  Rachel
 </i>
 , a cruise liner, when the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 intervenes with Michelle's whalesong generator. This, although, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 . The sub fires a harpoon made from the
 <i>
  Acushnet'
 </i>
 s hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.
</p>
<p>
 Moby-Dick surfaces too, and the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 , along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The sub gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab's harpoon. Moby-Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island's shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg (Michael Teh). Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale's other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 , including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab's orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the
 <i>
  Pequod
 </i>
 just as the island explodes. The film ends with the White Whale surviving to wreak havoc another day, and with Michelle swimming to the surface just as a rescue helicopter arrives.

 Moby Dick: Throughout the movie, Moby Dick has various exaggerated powers and sizes. According to the photographs and Michelle's estimates, Moby Dick is around 500 feet in length and can swim at amazing speeds. Moby Dick also possesses the ability to crawl very quickly on land for a short period of time and, in the beginning of the movie, was able to absorb sonar waves to avoid detection; this is later proved useless against high-tech submarine sonars. There is also a scientific error committed : at one point, Dr Michelle Herman says that the Sperm whale (67ft long) is the biggest existing whale in the world, but it is the Blue whale (98ft long).
