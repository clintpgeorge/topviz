   Neosqualodon
  </b>
 </i>
 is an extinct genus of toothed cetacean, that lived in the modern Italy in the Upper Oligocene (Burdigalian). Their fossils - mostly teeth and jaws - have been recovered in the Ragusa Formation of Sicilia, that are more robust and shorter than in the related genus
 <i>
  Squalodon
 </i>
 . Two species are known:
 <i>
  N. assenzae
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  N. gemellaroi
 </i>
 , that are distinguished by the shape of the teeth. Apparently this genus was endemic of the pre-Mediterranean sea of the Late Oligocene.
