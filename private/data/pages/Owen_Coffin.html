 <b>
  Owen Coffin
 </b>
 (August 24, 1802 â€“ February 2, 1821) was a teen-aged sailor aboard the Nantucket whaleship
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 when it set sail for the Pacific Ocean on a sperm whale-hunting expedition in August 1819, under the command of his cousin, George Pollard, Jr. In November the next year, a whale rammed and stove in the hull of the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 in mid-Pacific, and the ship sank steadily.

<p>
 The crew of the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 escaped in small whaleboats, with sufficient supplies for two months, but were not rescued in that time. During January 1821, the near-starved survivors began to eat the bodies of those who died. When even this resource ran out, the four men remaining in Pollard's boat agreed to draw straws to decide which of them should be slaughtered, lest all four die of starvation. Coffin 'lost' the lottery, and was shot and eaten. The captain volunteered to take his place but Coffin refused, saying it was his 'right' to do so that the others might live.

 The title song of the 1971 album
 <i>
  Nantucket Sleighride
 </i>
 by American rock band Mountain is titled in full "Nantucket Sleighride (To Owen Coffin)". While there is no evidence that the song is specifically about the Essex (and the lyrics are in parts obscure in meaning), it is written from the point of view of a sailor on a ship undertaking a "three-year tour... on a search for the mighty sperm whale", and co-writer Felix Pappalardi confirmed that the Owen Coffin in the dedication was the one from the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 tragedy, for example in an interview for the British music weekly
 <i>
  Sounds
 </i>
 (issue dated November 20, 1971).
</p>
<p>
 German funeral doom metal band Ahab released a concept album about the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 and one song directly references Coffin's fate in its title
 <i>
  Gnawing Bones (Coffin's Lot)
 </i>
 and its lyrics.

 The story of the
 <i>
  Essex
 </i>
 is known to have greatly interested the writer Herman Melville, who made annotations on a copy of an account of the shipwreck and its aftermath, written by the ship's surviving first mate, Owen Chase. The story of the Essex inspired part of Melville's novel,
 <i>
  Moby-Dick
 </i>
 .
