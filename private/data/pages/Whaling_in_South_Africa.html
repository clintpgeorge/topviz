 The practice of
 <b>
  whaling in South Africa
 </b>
 gained momentum at the start of the 19th century, and ended with a whaling ban in 1979. In 1806, a whaling station opened at Beacon Island on the Cape of Good Hope. In 1908, land-based commercial whaling stations opened in South Africa, but by 1936, whaling facilities were reduced to a single land station in Durban.

 By the 1960s, South Africa had depleted their populations of fin whales, and subsequently sperm and sei whales, and had to resort to hunting the small and less-profitable minke whale. Minke whales continued to be caught and brought to the Durban whaling station from 1968 until 1975.

 Whaling in South Africa came to an end in 1979, when the nation comprehensively banned whaling.
