Macrodelphinus kelloggi was an orca-sized relative of the cetacean Eurhinodelphis. It lived off the coast of what is now California during the early Miocene. Because of its size, and inch-long teeth, it is believed to have been an apex predator. Macrodelphinus is known from a fragmentary skull from southern California.
