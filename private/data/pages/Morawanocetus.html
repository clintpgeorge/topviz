  <b>
   Morawanocetus
  </b>
 </i>
 is a genus of extinct primitive baleen whale from the family Aetiocetidae that existed during the Chattian epoch of the late Oligocene period.
</p>
<p>
 Its fossils have been found in the North Pacific.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 was named by Barnes et al. in 1995, who described the species,
 <i>
  M. yabukii
 </i>
 . Three new species, dating from 17 to 19 million years ago, were unearthed between 2000 and 2005 in a road-widening project in California. These three new specimens of
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 , a genus thought to have gone extinct some five million years earlier, were discovered next to a fourth specimen, still under preparation, which clearly has archaeocete dentition.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 was divergent, with wide crania, elaborate cheek, tooth crowns, and short necks. The first fossils of
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 were found in the Chattian-aged Morawan Formation of Upper Oligocene Hokkaido. The more recent findings are the first
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 fossils found in California, a genus more commonly known to Japan.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Morawanocetus
 </i>
 is a sister taxa to:
 <i>
  Aetiocetus
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Ashorocetus
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  Chonecetus
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  Willungacetus
 </i>
 .
