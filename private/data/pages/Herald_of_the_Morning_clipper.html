 was designed by Samuel Hartt Pook. 'Her lines were sharp, approaching those of an actual clipper, yet she could carry in dead weight close to 1600 tons." The
 <i>
  Mauritius Commercial Gazeteer
 </i>
 described the bow of the
 <i>
  Herald of the Morning
 </i>
 as "so sharp as to take the form of a razor, the keel forming the edge; there are no rails at the bow, which is quite unencumbered." An 1854 "Boston Daily Atlas" writer was impressed by the beauty of her accommodations, and described the ship's overall appearance thus: "Her stern is oval in outline, and is finely ornamented with gilded carved work. She is sheathed with yellow metal, and is painted black outside; inside she is white, and the waterways blue, and her rack rail is covered with yellow metal fore and aft."
