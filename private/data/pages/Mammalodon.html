   Mammalodon

 is an extinct genus of archaic baleen whale although it lacked baleen and retained teeth. It was discovered in 1932 in the Jan Juc Formation on the small Bird Rock island south of the Point Lillias peninsula in Torquay, Victoria in Australia (38.3°S 144.3°E﻿ / -38.3; 144.3, paleocoordinates 52.9°S 142.2°E﻿ / -52.9; 142.2). It is one of two genera in the family Mammalodontidae.

 Description

<p>
 <i>
  Mammalodon
 </i>
 , with a length of 3 m (9.8 ft), was smaller and more basal than modern baleen whales.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Mammalodon
 </i>
 is a mix of archaeocete plesiomorphies (retained primitive traits) and mysticete synapomorphies (traits shared with more derived taxa), such as a short rostrum, reduced premaxillae, and orbits directed anterodorsally — defining features of mysticete.

<p>
 It had a short face, a delicate premaxilla with only one or two incisors and the lateral rim of the internal auditory meatus was lengthened towards the brain case which formed a longitudinal ridge.

 As with the closely related genus

  Mammalodon

 lacked baleen, instead possessing well-developed teeth. As such, it was not able to filter-feed in the same manner as extant baleen whales, making its diet and ecological niche a mystery. As the teeth are widely spaced, it has been suggested that they may have developed a method of filter-feeding unlike that of other whales. It is hypothosised that it was a bottom filter feeder, its blunt snout helping to suck up organisms from the sea floor.
