 History
</h2>
<p>
 Blubber Bay was a whale flensing station in the heyday of whaling on the British Columbia Coast, where whale blubber was sliced up from captured cetaceans. In 1970 there were 35 families living in a small company town owned by Domtar Chemical Company, quarrying limestone for concrete manufacture. Texada's other main community is Van Anda, on the island's east coast, which was an iron mining company town. Blubber Bay was also the site where Captain Cook first contacted the Tla' Amin people.
