Neosqualodon is an extinct genus of toothed cetacean, that lived in the modern Italy in the Upper Oligocene (Burdigalian). Their fossils - mostly teeth and jaws - have been recovered in the Ragusa Formation of Sicilia, that are more robust and shorter than in the related genus Squalodon. Two species are known: N. assenzae and N. gemellaroi, that are distinguished by the shape of the teeth. Apparently this genus was endemic of the pre-Mediterranean sea of the Late Oligocene.
