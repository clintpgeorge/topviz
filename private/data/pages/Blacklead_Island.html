 History
</h2>
<p>
 The island had been used by the Inuit for whaling. Later used by Europeans, it was known as the Blacklead Island Whaling Station, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1985. In 1894 the whaling station was purchased by Mr. C. Noble and offered to Edmund Peck as an Anglican mission. Peck made several trips to England and southern Canada over the years but always returned to the mission, until he finally left in 1902.
