<h2>
 History
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Viola
 </i>
 was built for the Hellyer Steam Fishing Company in 1906 by Cook, Welton &amp; Gemmell of Beverley, then floated down the River Hull to Hull where she was fitted with steam engines by the engineering firm of Amos &amp; Smith. She burnt coal until 1956 when she was converted to oil. She was part of the Hellyer Steam Fishing Company's North Sea fleet, and like much of Hellyer's fleet was named after a Shakespearean character.
</p>
<p>
 Hellyer's trawlers stayed out at sea for weeks at a time, transferring their catch to a fleet of five fast steam cutters which commuted between the fishing grounds and the fish markets of eastern England.
 <i>
  Viola
 </i>
 was regularly at sea for more than 310 days a year.

 at war
</h2>
<p>
 In September 1914,
 <i>
  Viola
 </i>
 was requisitioned by the Admiralty, renamed
 <i>
  Viola III
 </i>
 (FY 614) armed with a 3 pound gun and moved to Shetland, patrolling the waters out as far as Fair Isle looking for U-boats and escorting other vessels.
</p>
<p>
 Later in the war, the
 <i>
  Viola
 </i>
 was armed with a 12-pound gun, and transferred to the Tyne for minesweeping duty. She was one of the first vessels to use depth charges. She was also fitted with hydrophones. Along with other armed trawlers she was involved in actions resulting in the sinking of at least two U-boats: the UB-30 off Whitby on 13 August 1918, and the UB-115 off the Northumberland coast on 29 September.

 - whaling
</h2>
<p>
 Many vessels from Hellyer's North Sea fleet were lost during the war, and after the war they decided to concentrate on the distant fishing grounds off the coast of Iceland and the Barents Sea, selling off the remaining North Sea trawlers.
 <i>
  Viola
 </i>
 was sold to Massey &amp; Sons in 1918, and in the following year sold to L. Thorsen of Norway and renamed
 <i>
  Kapduen
 </i>
 . Thorsen were taken over by the whaling firm of Nils Torvald Nielsen Alonso, and the
 <i>
  Kapduen
 </i>
 was converted for whaling, being fitted with a new bridge forward of the funnel. She was renamed
 <i>
  Dias
 </i>
 in 1924 and over the next few years whaled off the coast of Africa. By 1927 she was laid up at Sandefjord.

  Dias
 </i>
 - sealing and expeditions
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Dias
 </i>
 was then sold to Compañía Argentina de Pesca, and moved to Grytviken in South Georgia for sealing.  She was also used as a support vessel for expeditions in the South Atlantic, supporting the Argentine weather station at Laurie Island, the Kohl-Larsen Expedition of 1928/9, the British South Georgia Expedition of 1954/55, the topographical surveys carried out by Duncan Carse between 1951 and 1957, and the Bird Island Expedition of 1958.

 Retirement and dereliction
</h2>
<p>
 In 1964 the whaling station at Grytviken closed, and
 <i>
  Dias
 </i>
 , along with another sealer,
 <i>
  Albatros
 </i>
 , was laid up. A caretaker was responsible for maintenance, painting and running the engines, but he left in 1971. Over the next few years snow and ice built up on the superstructure and the
 <i>
  Dias
 </i>
 foundered at her mooring in the winter of 1974.
 <i>
  Albatros
 </i>
 sank the following year.

 Rescue campaign
</h2>
<p>
 In 2004, as part of a project to restore and conserve Grytviken, the
 <i>
  Dias
 </i>
 and the
 <i>
  Albatros
 </i>
 were refloated and cleared of all remaining oil. Both ships have now been beached.
</p>
<p>
 An organisation, the "Friends of
 <i>
  Viola/Dias
 </i>
 ", seeks to preserve the ship, either
 <i>
  in situ
 </i>
 or by bringing her back to Hull.
</p>
<p>
 In 2006 the
 <i>
  Viola'
 </i>
 s original bell was discovered on a farm at Sandefjord and purchased by Hull Maritime Museum. In 2008 the bell was returned to the ship.
