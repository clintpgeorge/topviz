Peripolocetus is a genus of balaenoid baleen whale from the middle Miocene of Kern County, California.

Classification
Like other mysticetes that did not fall within extant mysticete groups, Peripolocetus was classified as a cetotheriid in the past. When named by American zoologist Remington Kellogg in 1931, it was assigned to Cetotheriidae, an opinion followed by subsequent authors. However, it was assigned to Mysticeti incertae sedis by one source, and one study has recovered Peripolocetus as a member of Balaenoidea.
