Balaenula is an extinct genus of cetacean known from the Pliocene of Belgium, Italy, and Japan.

Classification
There are two currently recognized species of Balaenula : the Belgian B. balaenopsis and the Italian B. astensis . An unnamed species from Japan (represented by a partial skeleton) is also known. Cladistic analyses of fossil and extant balaenids place Balaenula as the sister taxon of right whales in a clade separate from Bowhead Whale.
