 employed by orcas. An individual or small group of orcas will release bursts of bubble or flash their white undersides to round prey such as salmon or herring into a tight defensive bait ball close to the surface. The orcas then slap the ball with their tail, stunning or killing up to 10-15 herring with a successful slap. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian orca population and with some oceanic dolphin species.
