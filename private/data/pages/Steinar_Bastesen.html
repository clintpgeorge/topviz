 Bastesen became known for his vigorous advocacy of whaling, and usually appears on television wearing a seal-fur vest. In 1997, Canadian anti-whaling activist Paul Watson claimed in a NRK interview that Bastesen had threatened to kill him. Bastesen vehemently denied the allegation, and sued NRK for defamation of character by letting the interview air. Bastesen won in the Oslo District Court, but lost in the appeal court in 2002 as the court found that Watson's accusation was of journalistic interest.
