Miocaperea is an extinct genus of pygmy right whale from the late Miocene Pisco Formation of Peru. Its type species is Miocaperea pulchra.

Evolution and significance
The discovery of Miocaperea is significant because neobalaenids were previously unknown in the fossil record, except for an isolated petrosal (ear bone) from late Miocene-aged deposits in Australia. A previous study placed the divergence date of Neobalaenidae from other mysticetes at about 23 million years, and the age of Miocaperea lends credence to the notion of an origin for Neobalaenidae deep in the early Miocene.
