 Family history
</h2>
<p>
 Tristram Coffin, born in 1609 in Plymouth, England, left Brixton, Devonshire, England, for America in 1642, first settling in Newbury, Massachusetts, then moving to Nantucket. The Coffin family, along with other Nantucket families, including the Gardners and the Starbucks, began whaling seriously in the 1690s in local waters, and by 1715 the family owned three whalers and a trade vessel. In 1763, six men of the Coffin family were captains of ships sailing out of Nantucket, and travelling as far as South America and Greenland.

 James Coffin
</h2>
<p>
 On 31 May 1823, the British ship
 <i>
  Transit
 </i>
 arrived in Batavia, on the island of Java, having lost its master, Capt Alexander, to a whale near Christmas Island. James Coffin was on Java at the time and was appointed as captain.
</p>
<p>
 Later that year, while working in the central Pacific, James is said to have discovered Enderbury Island in the Phoenix group, naming it "Enderby's Island" after the London whaling house. However, when he described his own discoveries of the Bonins to Arrowsmith and other geographers, he did not mention Enderbury.

 Joshua Coffin

<p>
 Some records suggest that Joshua, while captaining the whaler
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 , sighted and named Gardner Island in the Phoenix Group in 1825, probably naming it after U.S. Congressman Gideon Gardner, the owner of the
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Alternative sources claim the island was sighted by whaler Joshua Gardner, also reported to have captained the
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 in 1825.

 Reuben Coffin

<p>
 Interestingly, some sources report that in 1823 a "Reuben Coffin" was captain of an American whaler named
 <i>
  Transit
 </i>
 , out of Nantucket, and was responsible for the discovery of the Bonin Islands. Anchoring unchallenged off Haha Jima, he claimed the islands for the United States, naming them "Coffin Islands".

 Various "Captain Coffins"
</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
  A "Captain Coffin", master and part-owner of the
  <i>
   Thule
  </i>
  , Nantucket, after 27 months at sea, struck the "Booby Shoals" on Bellona Reefs, near the Chesterfield Islands on 10 September 1844, and was wrecked; the ship was carrying 1050 barrels of sperm oil. Two boats, manned by 16 men, managed to reach Moreton Bay, Queensland, on 20 September, but a third boat was lost. Losing most of their possessions in the wreck, the sailors were replenished by Brisbane residents. Shipping lists show that Coffin, Mr W Thompson and 13 crew members took passage from Moreton Bay on the steamer
  <i>
   Sovereign
  </i>
  , departing 4 October, and arriving in Port Jackson on 8 October. Capt Coffin left Port Jackson on 17th aboard the schooner
  <i>
   Vanguard
  </i>
  , bound for New Zealand.
 </li>
 <li>
  After Englishman Robert Hunter discovered the original "siamese twins" Chang and Eng in Siam in 1824, he sent them to America in 1829 in the care of "Captain Coffin", who became close enough to them to receive letters from their manager James Hale.
 </li>
 <li>
  Records tell of a "Captain Coffin", whose leg was badly injured in a whaling accident. with no surgeon on board, Coffin ordered his mate to cut off the leg with a knife, threatening to shoot him if he did not obey. He held the pistol pointing at the mate throughout the operation.
