  <b>
   Eschrichtioides
  </b>
 </i>
 is an extinct genus of eschrichtiid from the early Pliocene of northern Italy. Its type species,
 <i>
  E. gastaldii
 </i>
 , had a superfluous taxonomic history, starting as a cetothere, then as an extinct balaenopterid, before being finally recognized as a relative of the gray whale.

<h2>
 Classification
</h2>
<p>
 Like other thalassotheres from the Italian Pliocene, the classification of
 <i>
  Eschrichtioides
 </i>
 was highly contentious. It was originally misidentified as the balaenopterid "Balaena"
 <i>
  cortesii
 </i>
 ,(who regarded "B."
 <i>
  cortesii
 </i>
 as a species of
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 ) but later described as a new species of
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  C. gastaldii
 </i>
 . However, several authors considered it to be referrable to
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 , a taxonomic arrangement which was accepted for more than a century. However, re-examination of MRSN 13802 revealed that "C." gastaldii was not a balaenopterid and instead constituted its own genus within Eschrichtiidae.
