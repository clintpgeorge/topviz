 was a Norwegian whaling vessel laid down in 1881 in Rødsverven, Norway, the same shipyard which later built Ernest Shackleton's ship the Endurance. The ship, financed by Christen Christensen, an entrepreneur from Sandefjord, was noted for its participation in an 1892-1893 Antarctic expedition led by Carl Anton Larsen.

 Additionally, the vessel was noted for reaching 68°10'S, setting a new record for distance travelled south along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula. The ship's first mate during the expedition was Søren Andersen, also of Sandefjord. The

 From 1892 to 1894, the ship was used on scientific whaling expeditions to the Antarctic, funded by A/S Oceana. The purpose of these expeditions were to map the presence of whales and seals in the area. During this mission, the

 The ship was sold to the Italian prince and explorer Luigi Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta in 1899 and named the
 <i>
  Stella Polare
 </i>
 . Amedeo gathered an expeditionary crew of Italian and Norwegian civilians and sailed from Christiana on 12 June of that year. By the 30th, they had reached Archangel, Russia to load sled dogs onto the ship. Leaving Russia, they headed for Franz Josef Land. They landed in Teplitz Bay in Rudolf Island, with a hope to establish a winter camp for the expedition. From here, they established a string of camps designed to supply each other with food and men. During the expedition, Amedeo lost two fingers to frostbite, and had to hand command of the voyage over to Captain Umberto Cagni. On 25 April 1900, Cagni planted the Italian flag at 86°34'N, claiming the title of "Farthest North."
