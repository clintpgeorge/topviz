Squalodontidae is an extinct family of toothed whales named by Jean-Pierre Sylvestre de Grateloup in 1840. It was originally believed to be an iguanodontid dinosaur but has since been reclassified.
Squalodontidae is derived from the word "Squalodon", literally meaning "shark tooth". Unlike other whales which have peg-like teeth, those of squalodontids were serrated like a sharks.
