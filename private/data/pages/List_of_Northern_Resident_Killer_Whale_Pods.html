 This is a list of Northern resident killer whale pods that live off the coast of British Columbia, Canada as of March 2013. The Northern Resident community is found in coastal waters ranging from mid-Vancouver Island to Southeastern Alaska up through the Queen Charlotte Islands. Northern residents live in close-knit family groups known as pods that frequently split in subpods during the winter months and feed only on fish. They have never been seen spending time with other communities, although their territories often overlap.
