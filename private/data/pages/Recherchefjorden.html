 History
</h2>
<p>
 The fjord is named after the French cruiser
 <i>
  La Recherche
 </i>
 , which visited Spitsbergen in 1838 and 1839. Before being renamed, it had been called
 <i>
  Schoonhaven
 </i>
 (English: Clean Bay) by the Dutch since the early 17th century. The English commonly called it
 <i>
  Ice Bay
 </i>
 . Both countries established several whaling stations within the fjord in the first half of the seventeenth century, most notably LÃ¦gerneset on the eastern side of the fjord.
