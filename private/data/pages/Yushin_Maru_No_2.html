 Sea Shepherd confrontations
</h2>
<p>
 On January 15, 2008, two members (Ben Potts and Giles Lane) of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, traveling on the MV
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 , boarded the
 <i>
  Yūshin Maru No. 2
 </i>
 without permission. They were accordingly detained on board the ship for two days before being transferred to the Australian customs vessel MV
 <i>
  Oceanic Viking
 </i>
 . During their detainment, they were offered whale meat for dinner.
</p>
<p>
 On February 6, 2009, the MV
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 collided with the
 <i>
  Yūshin Maru No. 2
 </i>
 as the activist vessel attempted to obstruct the transfer of a whale up the slipway of the factory ship
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru
 </i>
 . Both sides claimed the other responsible. Pete Thomas of the LA Times speculated as to "whether [Mr. Watson's] actions are truly on behalf of the whales, or merely to obtain dramatic footage for the Animal Planet series,
 <i>
  Whale Wars
 </i>
 ".
