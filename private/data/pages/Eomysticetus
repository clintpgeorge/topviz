Eomysticetus is an extinct genus of toothless baleen whale from the late Oligocene (Chattian) Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina.

Physical characteristics
Eomysticetus is a member of the family Eomysticetidae, which also includes the Japanese form Yamatocetus and also "Mauicetus" lophocephalus and "M." waitakiensis from New Zealand. Like other members of the mysticete clade Chaeomysticeti, its jaws had baleen instead of teeth, meaning that it could filter plankton with its baleen plates.
Unlike modern baleen whales, Eomysticetus had a blowhole that was positioned ahead of the eyes, and the characteristics of its vertebrae and flipper bones are akin to those of archaeocetes like Basilosaurus.

Taxonomy
There are two species of Eomysticetus , E. whitmorei and E. carolinensis , both from the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina.
