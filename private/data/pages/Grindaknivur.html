 There are no specific formal requirements to the whaling knife. In most cases the length of the blade is between 16 and 19 cm. The whaling knife is considered as one of the foremost Faroese contributions to Nordic artistic craftsmanship. The knife is used for the traditional method of killing pilot whales; to sever the spinal cord with a cut across the back of the neck of the animal between the head and the neck.
