<h2>
 Physical characteristics
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Eomysticetus
 </i>
 is a member of the family Eomysticetidae, which also includes the Japanese form
 <i>
  Yamatocetus
 </i>
 and also "Mauicetus"
 <i>
  lophocephalus
 </i>
 and "M."
 <i>
  waitakiensis
 </i>
 from New Zealand. Like other members of the mysticete clade Chaeomysticeti, its jaws had baleen instead of teeth, meaning that it could filter plankton with its baleen plates.
</p>
<p>
 Unlike modern baleen whales,
 <i>
  Eomysticetus
 </i>
 had a blowhole that was positioned ahead of the eyes, and the characteristics of its vertebrae and flipper bones are akin to those of archaeocetes like Basilosaurus.
