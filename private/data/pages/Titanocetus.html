 Discovery
</h2>
<p>
 The fossil remains of
 <i>
  Titanocetus
 </i>
 was discovered within some marine deposits dating back to the Serravallian (middle Miocene) and belonging to the "Fumaiolo Formation" (Republic of San Marino). The whale was then described in 1900 by the italian paleontologist Giovanni Capellini, who later (1901) named it
 <i>
  Aulocetus sammarinensis
 </i>
 . Over a century later, in 2006, the paleontologist Michelangelo Bisconti stated that the remains was too different from the type species of the genus
 <i>
  Aulocetus
 </i>
 and thus estabilished a new genus,
 <i>
  Titanocetus
 </i>
 .

 Description
</h2>
<p>
 This whale was similar in appearance to the living Balaenopteridae, although it was considerably smaller in size: the skull barely exceeded one meter in total length, while the entire animal would reached around six meters.
 <br/>
 Considered nowadays to be a primitive member of the Mysticeti, already equipped with baleen,
 <i>
  Titanocetus
 </i>
 was a carrier of both modern (i.e. the rostrum, wide and flat) and ancestral characters (i.e. the squamosal and parietal bones, which occupy part of the temporal fenestra).
