  <b>
   Plesiocetus
  </b>
 </i>
 is a genus of extinct balaenopterid from the Pliocene (Zanclean) of Belgium. It has had a chequered taxonomic history, having served as a wastebasket genus for a handful of mysticete species.

<h2>
 Taxonomy
</h2>
<p>
 The genus
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 was originally coined for three mysticete species from Neogene marine deposits in the vicinity of Antwerp, Belgium:
 <i>
  P. garopii
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  P. hupschii
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  P. burtinii
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The three originally included species of
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 went about their separate ways.
 <i>
  P. garopii
 </i>
 was designated the type species of the genus, while the other two were referred to
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 .(
 <i>
  P. hupschii
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  P. burtinii
 </i>
 were later assigned to
 <i>
  Plesiocetopsis
 </i>
 , which was originally erected as a subgenus of
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 ) Later, van Beneden noted the similarities of
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 with the fin whale, so he renamed
 <i>
  Plesiocetus garopii
 </i>
 into
 <i>
  Balaenoptera musculoides
 </i>
 , which is invalid under current ICZN rules. At the same time, he also erected the new species
 <i>
  P. brialmontii
 </i>
 on the basis of fragmentary remains, while referring
 <i>
  Cetotherium dubius
 </i>
 to
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The taxonomy of
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 by now was confused.
 <i>
  Plesiocetus garopii
 </i>
 was referred to
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 (making
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 a synonym of
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 ), while
 <i>
  P. hupschii
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  P. burtinii
 </i>
 were assigned to
 <i>
  Cetotherium
 </i>
 . To avoid nomenclatorial complications,
 <i>
  Plesiocetus hupschii
 </i>
 was designated the type species of
 <i>
  Plesiocetopsis
 </i>
 , removing any synonymy between
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Plesiocetopsis
 </i>
 . Recent studies, however, indicate that
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 shares no characters with
 <i>
  Balaenoptera
 </i>
 to the exclusion of other balaenopterids. For its part,
 <i>
  P. burtinii
 </i>
 was referred to Aglaocetus, while
 <i>
  P. brialmontii
 </i>
 was declared a nomen dubium. These revisions leave
 <i>
  P. garopii
 </i>
 the type and only species of
 <i>
  Plesiocetus
 </i>
 .
