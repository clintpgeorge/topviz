 traces its origins back to 1844 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. As the whaling industry’s center, New Bedford proved a hot spot to start an oil and lubricant company. The company was founded by William F. Nye.

 Nye Lubricants Today
</h2>
<p>
 William Foster Nye's company is still in business today. Nye Lubricants, Inc is now owned by its third set of owners and can be found in William Nye's hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. They had originally bought the business only for the real estate, but then decided to rejuvenate the company after seeing its client list which included GE and IBM. They continued to obtain raw blackfish head oil from Newfoundland. Later, they formed new supply agreements with a fishing cooperative in the British West Indies, where natives still hunted blackfish for food.

 They also saw the writing on the wall; the harvesting of ocean mammals was threatening their extinction. They also understood the technical advantages of the emerging synthetic oils and highly-refined mineral oils. In the early 1960s, more than a decade before the Marine Mammal Protection Act outlawed the importing of the company's traditional raw material, the new owners began the transition from porpoise oil to synthetic functional fluids.

 Today, synthetic hydrocarbons, esters, polyglycols, silicones. polyphenyl and fluorinated ethers are the "raw materials" for Nye lubricants. But the tradition that began more than 150 years ago continues.
