 </b>
 was a traveling sideshow attraction in the United States of America from the late 1967 until the mid-1990s. The 20-ton sperm whale was hauled around the United States by trucker Jerry "Tyrone" Malone in Old Blue, a refrigerated tractor-trailer.

 The whale was purchased in 1967 for $6,000.00 US from the Del-Monte Fishing Company, which had captured the whale off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, with plans to sell the carcass for dog food. On July 9, 1967, the frozen whale made its debut at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, and traveled the State Fair and roadside attraction circuit for over 25 years.
