Godthul is a bay 1 mile (1.6 km) long entered between Cape George and Long Point, on the north coast of South Georgia, between Cumberland East Bay and Ocean Harbour. The name Godthul (Norwegian for "Good Hollow") dates back to the period 1905–12, and was probably applied by Norwegian sealers and whalers working in the area.
It operated between 1908–1929, and was only a rudimentary land base, with main operations on a factory ship. It had an interruption between 1917–22 partly due to World War I.
