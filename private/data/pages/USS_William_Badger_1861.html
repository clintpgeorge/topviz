 -- a wooden-hulled whaling ship -- was purchased by the Union Navy on 18 May 1861 from Henry F. Thomas, at New Bedford, Massachusetts. Built in 1829, it was the 100th vessel constructed by master shipbuilder William Badger of Badger's Island in Kittery, Maine, so it received the name reserved for that honor.
