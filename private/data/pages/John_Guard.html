 Early life
</h2>
<p>
 Guard was born in London in 1791 or 1792. On 17 March 1813 at age 21, the stonecutter was convicted of stealing a quilt and sentenced to transportation and five years hard labour. At the end of his sentence, he worked as a sealer, and after five or six years had his own boat and crew.

 Guard can lay credit to a number of European firsts in New Zealand's South Island. His whaling station, established at Te Awaiti on the Arapawa Island shore of Tory Channel in 1827, was the first permanent settlement in the South Island. (previous whaling stations having been seasonal) Guard's wife Elizabeth or Betty (née Parker, 1814–1870) whom he married in Sydney in 1830, was the first European woman to settle in the South Island. Guard's son, John junior (born 1 October 1831) was the first European child born in the South Island and his daughter Louisa (born late 1833) the first female child.

 A year after starting the Te Awaiti station, in 1828, he started a branch whaling station at Port Underwood using the ship Waterloo. He used the ship to transport flax,whale oil and seal skins to Sydney 3 times per year, returning with supplies and trade goods. Later he had to abandon the Te Awaiti station.

 In 1834 he was wrecked off the Taranaki coast in the

 with his wife and family. In the Harriet Affair, a group of British soldiers of the 50th Regiment from Australia landed in Taranaki to rescue his wife and two children, John and Louisa and punish the kidnappers. This was the first clash between Māori and British troops. The expedition sent by Governor Bourke from Sydney was subsequently criticised by a British House of Commons report in 1835.

 He settled permanently at Port Underwood in 1836, and was still whaling off the Kaikoura coast in the 1840s. About this time onshore whaling ceased to be economically viable in New Zealand. His later life is unknown, but he probably farmed at Kakapo Bay.
