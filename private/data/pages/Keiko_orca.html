 History
</h2>
<p>
 Keiko, whose name means "lucky one" in the Japanese language but is given only to females, was captured near Reyðarfjörður, Iceland in 1979 and sold to the Icelandic aquarium in Hafnarfjörður. Three years later he was sold to Marineland in Ontario where he first started performing for the public and developed skin lesions indicative of poor health. He was then sold to Reino Aventura (now named Six Flags Mexico), an amusement park in Mexico City, in 1985. He was the star of the movie
 <i>
  Free Willy
 </i>
 in 1993.
</p>
<p>
 The publicity from his role in
 <i>
  Free Willy
 </i>
 led to an effort by Warner Brothers Studio to find him a better home. Donations from the studio and Craig McCaw led to the establishment of the
 <i>
  Free Willy-Keiko Foundation
 </i>
 in February 1995. With donations from the foundation and millions of school children, the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon was given over $7 million to construct facilities to return him to health with the hope of returning him to the wild. UPS provided ground transportation to the nearby Newport Municipal Airport in a specialized container. Weighing 3500 kg (7720 pounds), he was transported by air in a C-130 Hercules donated by UPS to his new home on January 7, 1996. During his years in Oregon his weight increased over a ton.

 The plan to return him to the wild was a topic of much controversy. Some felt his years of captivity made such a return impossible. Researchers in a scientific study later said attempts to return him to the wild were misguided. The Norwegian pro-whaling politician Steinar Bastesen made international news for his statement that Keiko should instead be killed and the meat sent to Africa as foreign aid. Nevertheless, the process of preparing Keiko for the wild began on September 9, 1998, when he was flown to Klettsvík, a bay on the island of Heimaey in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland. Upon landing, the C-17 Globemaster aircraft suffered a landing gear failure causing over $1 million in damage, though Keiko was unharmed. His day-to-day care became the responsibility of the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation with management assistance from the Ocean Futures Society. He underwent training designed to prepare him for his eventual release, including supervised swims in the open ocean.
</p>
<p>
 Ocean Futures left the Keiko project in late 2001. The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation and The Humane Society of the United States re-established management of the project at that time until Keiko's death in 2003. Keiko was finally released in the open in July 2002. However, about six weeks later he showed up in a Norwegian fjord, apparently seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back. He continued to follow a boat responsible for his care and failed to reintegrate into the wild.

 Death
</h2>
<p>
 Keiko died in Taknes Bay, Norway while swimming in the fjords on December 12, 2003, at about 27 years of age. Pneumonia was determined as his probable cause of death by his Veterinarian. Keiko was buried in the cover of darkness in the middle of a blizzard with three members(an American, Icelander, and Norwegian) of his team present, the land owners and the machine operator. Members of the paparazzi tried to get pictures of Keiko's dead body. Keiko was buried like a Nordic King with Thor's hammer sounding off during the ceremony.
</p>
<p>
 There is a memorial site for Keiko set up by the locals in Halsa, Norway. Norwegian school children built a wooden cairn to mark the spot where he is buried. Tourists continue to travel to Norway every year to see Keiko’s final resting place, honoring his legacy as the most famous whale in the world and an ambassador of captive whales worldwide.
