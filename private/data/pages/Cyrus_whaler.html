 The barque
 <i>
  <b>
   Cyrus
  </b>
 </i>
 was the British whaling vessel captained by Richard Spratly, namesake of Spratly Island and the group of islands and reefs known as the Spratly Islands. The
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 sailed during the 1840s. The
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 also transported valuable cargo between the South Pacific and Great Britain.
</p>
<p>
 The vessel was owned by a man known only as "Mr. Joe".
</p>
<p>
 This vessel should not be confused with the American whaler, the
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 of Nantucket, which sailed during the same era. A bill of sale in the Nantucket Historical Association Research Library shows that a whaling vessel named
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 had several owners and was registered in London in 1916. Several sources speak of a
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 and an incident at Pitcairn, but some call it a London whaler and others an American whaler. However, testimony from the crew confirms this ship was sailing elsewhere under a different Captain.

<h2>
 Possible location
</h2>
<p>
 There are a few whalers named
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 from the same era. Spratly's
 <i>
  Cyrus
 </i>
 may be one of these shipwrecks:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  On 23 December 1858 the Brig
  <i>
   Cyrus
  </i>
  took shelter from a storm off Cape Flattery, Vancouver Island. She anchored in Port San Juan, but her anchor chain broke and she was driven ashore near the mouth of the Gordon river.

 <li>
  Hartlepool, England. 9 February 1861.
