Ambrein is a fragrant substance that is used in the perfume industry. It is the chief constituent of ambergris, a secretion from the digestive system of the sperm whale, and has been suggested as the possible active component producing the supposed aphrodisiac effects of ambergris.
It is a triterpene alcohol.
It has been shown to act as an analgesic and increase sexual behaviour in rats, providing some support for its traditional aphrodisiac use.
