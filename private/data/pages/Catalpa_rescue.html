 was the escape, in 1876, of six Irish Fenian prisoners from what was then the British penal colony of Western Australia.

<h2>
 Fenians and plans to escape
</h2>
<p>
 From 1865 to 1867, British authorities rounded up supporters of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to the penal colony of Western Australia. Among them was John Boyle O'Reilly, later to become the editor of the Boston newspaper
 <i>
  The Pilot
 </i>
 . They were sent on the convict ship
 <i>
  Hougoumont
 </i>
 and landed at Fremantle, in January 1868, after which they were moved to the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison).
</p>
<p>
 In 1869, O'Reilly escaped on the whaling ship
 <i>
  Gazelle
 </i>
 with assistance of the local Catholic priest, Father Patrick McCabe, and settled in Boston. Soon after his arrival, O'Reilly found work with
 <i>
  The Pilot
 </i>
 newspaper and eventually became editor. In 1871, another Fenian, John Devoy, was granted amnesty in England, among others, on condition that he settle outside Ireland, and he sailed to New York City. He also became a newspaperman, for the
 <i>
  New York Herald
 </i>
 . He joined the Clan na Gael, an organization that supported armed insurrection in Ireland.
</p>
<p>
 In 1869, pardons had been issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians. Another round of pardons were issued in 1871, after which only a small group of militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system. In 1873, Devoy received a smuggled letter from imprisoned Fenian James Wilson, who was among those the British had not released. He asked them to aid the escape of the remaining Fenian prisoners. Devoy discussed the matter with O'Reilly and Thomas McCarthy Fennell, and Fennell suggested that a ship be purchased, laden with a legitimate cargo, and sailed to Western Australia, where it would not be expected to arouse suspicion. The Fenian prisoners would then be rescued by stealth rather than force of arms. Devoy approached the 1874 convention of the Clan na Gael and got the Clan to agree to fund a rescue of the men. He then approached whaling agent John T. Richardson, who told them to contact his son-in-law, whaling captain George Smith Anthony, who agreed to help.
</p>
<p>
 James Reynolds, a member of the Clan and on the committee to rescue the prisoners, bought under his name for the Clan a three-masted whaling bark
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 for $5,200, and George Anthony recruited twenty-two sailors. On 29 April 1875,
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts. At first, most of the crew was unaware of their real mission. Anthony noticed too late that the ship's marine chronometer was broken, so he had to rely on his own skills for navigation. First they sailed to Faial Island in Azores, where they off-loaded 210 barrels of sperm whale oil. Unfortunately, much of the crew deserted the ship, and they had to leave three sick men behind. Anthony recruited replacement crew members and set sail for Western Australia.
</p>
<p>
 At the same time, two Fenian agents, John Breslin and Tom Desmond, had arrived in Western Australia in September. Breslin masqueraded as an American businessman "James Collins", with suitable letter of introduction, and got acquainted with Sir William Cleaver Robinson, Governor of Western Australia. Robinson took Breslin on a tour of the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison). Desmond took a job as a wheelwright and recruited five local Irishmen who were to cut the telegraph lines connecting Australia on the day of escape.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 fell behind the intended schedule due to a serious storm, in which she lost her foremast. She dropped anchor off Bunbury on 27 March 1876. Anthony and Breslin met. The pair began to prepare for the rescue.
</p>
</div>

<h2>
 Escape and pursuit
</h2>
<p>
 The first intended day for escape was 6 April, but the appearance of
 <i>
  HMS Convict
 </i>
 and other Royal Navy ships and customs officers quickly led to a postponement. The escape was rearranged for 17 April, when most of the Convict Establishment garrison was watching the Royal Perth Yacht Club regatta.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 dropped anchor in international waters off Rockingham and dispatched a whaleboat to the shore.
</p>
<p>
 At 8.30 am, six Fenians who were working in work parties outside the prison walls, absconded - Thomas Darragh, Martin Hogan, Michael Harrington, Thomas Hassett, Robert Cranston and James Wilson – were met by Breslin and Desmond and picked up in carriages. A seventh Fenian, James Kiely, had been exposed as an informer by his fellow prisoners and left behind.
</p>
<p>
 The men raced 50 km south to Rockingham where Anthony awaited them on the beach with a rowboat. A local he had spoken to earlier saw the men and quickly alerted the authorities.
</p>
<p>
 The rowboat faced difficulties on its return to the
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 due to a storm that lasted till dawn on 18 April. The storm was so intense that Anthony later stated that he didn't expect the small boat to survive.
</p>
<p>
 At 7am, with the storm over, they again made for the Catalpa but an hour later spotted the steamship
 <i>
  SS Georgette
 </i>
 which had been commandeered by the colonial governor making for the whaler.
</p>
<p>
 The men lay down in the rowboat and it was not seen by the Georgette which was forced to return to Fremantle to refuel after following the Catalpa for several hours.
</p>
<p>
 As the rowboat again made for the ship a police cutter with 30 - 40 armed men was spotted. The two boats raced to reach the Catalpa first, with the rowboat winning and the men climbing aboard as the police cutter passed by. The cutter turned, lingered briefly beside the Catalpa, and then headed to shore.
</p>
<p>
 Early on 19 April the refueled and now heavily armed
 <i>
  Georgette
 </i>
 returned and came alongside the whaler, demanding the surrender of the prisoners and attempting to herd the ship back into Australian waters.
</p>
<p>
 They fired a warning shot with the 12 pounder (5 kg) cannon that had been installed the night before. Ignoring the demand to surrender, Anthony had raised, and then pointed towards, the U.S. flag, informed the
 <i>
  Georgette
 </i>
 that an attack on the
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 would be considered an act of war against the USA, and proceeded westward.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Georgette
 </i>
 pursued until it was low on fuel and turned away.
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 slipped into the Indian Ocean.

<h2>
 Aftermath
</h2>
<p>
 Due to cut telegraph cables, news of the escape did not reach London until June. The cables were cut by volunteers John Durham and Denis F. McCarthy, a native of Kenmare, Co. Kerry.
</p>
<p>
 At the same time, the
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 did its best to avoid Royal Navy ships on its way back to the USA. O'Reilly received the news of the escape on 6 June (Stevens 2003, p. 352) and released the news to the press.
</p>
<p>
 The news sparked celebrations in the United States and Ireland and anger in Britain and Australia (although there was also sympathy for the cause within the Australian population).
</p>
<p>
 A purge of prison officials in Fremantle followed. The
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 returned to New York harbor on 19 August 1876.
</p>
<p>
 George Smith Anthony could no longer sail in international waters because the Royal Navy could have arrested him on sight. With the help of a journalist, Z. W. Pease, he published an account of his journey,
 <i>
  The Catalpa Expedition
 </i>
 , in 1897.
</p>
<p>
 The Catalpa was presented as a gift to Captain Anthony, John Richardson and Henry Hathaway, it was eventually sold and turned into a coal barge.
</p>
<p>
 Not of great value in this capacity, Catalpa was finally condemned at the port of Belize, British Honduras.

<h2>
 Memorials
</h2>
<p>
 On 9 September 2005 a memorial was unveiled in Rockingham to commemorate the escape.
</p>
<p>
 The memorial, a large statue of six wild geese, was created by Western Australian artists Charlie Smith and Joan Walsh Smith. The geese refer to the phrase "The Wild Geese", which was a name given to Irish soldiers who served in European armies after being exiled from Ireland.
</p>
<p>
 The Fenians transported to Western Australia adopted the phrase for themselves during their voyage to Western Australia on board the
 <i>
  Hougoumont
 </i>
 , even publishing a shipboard newspaper entitled
 <i>
  The Wild Goose
 </i>
 .
</p>
<p>
 A memorial stone was erected in New Bedford, Massachusetts, home port of Catalpa and her crew.
</p>

 Exhibition
</h2>
<p>
 From 22 September 2006 to 3 December 2006 an exhibition, called "Escape: Fremantle to Freedom," opened at Fremantle Prison displaying many artifacts relating to the
 <i>
  Catalpa
 </i>
 rescue.
</p>
<p>
 Over 20,000 visitors passed through. There was no cost to enter the exhibit, which used modern touchscreen systems to allow reading of many books, journals, and diaries on display for the first time.
</p>
<p>
 After three months at Fremantle, the exhibition is scheduled to travel around museums throughout Australia.
