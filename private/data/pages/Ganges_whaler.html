 The
 <i>
  <b>
   Ganges
  </b>
 </i>
 was a whaleship from Nantucket, Massachusetts operating in the Pacific Ocean during the mid-nineteenth century. It was probably the vessel reported to have found Gardner Island in the Phoenix group. Although Barzillai Folger, the master of the ship during its voyage of 1835-39, is sometimes credited with being the first to discover the right whales of the Northwest coast, he was preceded by the Frenchman Narcisse Chaudiere in the
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 . Chaudiere cruised on this ground during the summer of 1835, while Folger didn’t leave port until October 26 of the same year.

 Discovery of Gardner Island
</h2>
<p>
 Capt. Joshua Gardner, reportedly on board the whaleship
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 , discovered an island in 1825, located at 4°20' S, 174°22' W, and named it "Gardner's Island". His discovery was reported in the
 <i>
  Nantucket Enquirer
 </i>
 , December 1827. However, contemporary Joshua Coffin (also reportedly on the
 <i>
  Ganges
 </i>
 ) is sometimes credited with the discovery, naming the island after his ship's owner, Gideon Gardner.
