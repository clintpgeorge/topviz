<h2>
 Taxonomy
</h2>
<p>
 There are four recognized species of
 <i>
  Herpetocetus
 </i>
 :
 <i>
  H. scaldiensis
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  H. transatlanticus
 </i>
 ,
 <i>
  H. bramblei
 </i>
 , and
 <i>
  H. morrowi
 </i>
 . An additional unnamed species from Japan has been referred to the
 <i>
  nomen dubium
 </i>
 <i>
  Mizuhoptera sendaicus
 </i>
 in the past, but the undiagnostic nature of the holotype of the latter means that it cannot be confidently referred to
 <i>
  M. sendaicus
 </i>
 .

<h2>
 Survival into the Pleistocene
</h2>
<p>
 A recently discovered specimen of
 <i>
  Herpetocetus
 </i>
 from the Lower-Middle Pleistocene (Gelasian) Falor Formation of northern California indicates that
 <i>
  Herpetocetus
 </i>
 survived into the early Pleistocene, shedding light on the diversity of mysticetes in the early Pleistocene. Since other cetotheriids went extinct by the end of the Neogene, it's therefore possible that some Pliocene representatives of Cetotheriidae made it into the Pleistocene to co-exist with extant mysticete species.
