 Description
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 was around 2 metres (6.6Â ft) in length. In most respects, it would have looked like a modern dolphin or porpoise, but its upper jaw was elongated into a sharp tip similar to that of a swordfish. Most likely,
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 used it in a similar manner to swordfish, hitting or stabbing prey. It also had long, sharp teeth.
</p>
<p>
 Compared with earlier fossil species,
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 had complex ears, suggesting that it already hunted by echolocation like modern whales. Its brain was also asymmetrical, a trait found in modern dolphins, and possibly associated with the complexities of navigating its environment.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 was closely related to the orca-sized
 <i>
  Macrodelphinus
 </i>
 .

 History
</h2>
<p>
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 was first described by B. Du Bus in a paper read before the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium on 17 December, 1867. O. Abel studied and illustrated the European species in a series of articles published in 1901, 1902 and 1905; subsequently, fossil skulls found in the Calvert Formation in Maryland and Virginia could be attributed to this genus.
