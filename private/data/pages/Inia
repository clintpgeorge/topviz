Inia is a genus of river dolphin containing one to three species.

Taxonomy
The genus was described by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1834 when Delphinus geoffrensis , described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1817, was recognized to be a unique taxon. A 1998 classification listed a single species, Inia geoffrensis , in the genus Inia , with three recognized subspecies. Most of the scientific community accepted this single species classification, as did the IUCN. In 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy started considering the Bolivian ( Inia geoffrensis boliviensis ) subspecies as a full species, Inia boliviensis . In 2014, the population in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin was recognized to be an additional species, Inia araguaiaensis .
