 The 8,725 ton
 <i>
  <b>
   Hiyo Maru
  </b>
 </i>
 (飛鷹丸) was the largest member of the Japanese whaling fleet; providing fuel, resources, and stock storage space for that fleet and its crew. In 1992, it was renamed and re-flagged to Panama as the
 <i>
  Oriental Bluebird
 </i>
 . According to Greenpeace, after a dispute with the Panamanian Government in 2008, it was de-flagged and re-registered to Japan. The
 <i>
  Hiyo Maru
 </i>
 served as the fuel tanker for Japan's whaling fleet, and was alleged by Greenpeace to also transport whale meat. In August 2010, the ship was sold to China to be scrapped.
