 is a ship owned and operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, named after American television game show host and animal rights activist Bob Barker, whose donation of $5 million to the society facilitated the purchase of the ship. She first started operating for the group in late 2009 / early 2010 in its campaign against whaling by Japanese fisheries. In October 2010, Sea Shepherd stated that
 <i>
  Bob Barker

 had completed a massive refit in Hobart, Tasmania. Hobart is now the ship's Honorary home port.

<h3>
 Overview
</h3>
<p>
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 is described as a "long range fast ice" vessel of 801 tonnes (788 long tons) (or 1,200 t (1,200 long tons) according to some other references). It was built in Norway in 1950 as the whale catcher
 <i>
  Pol XIV
 </i>
 , but was deleted from the Norwegian ship registry in 2004, and sold to a Cook Islands registry concern. It was eventually purchased by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and refitted in Africa.
</p>
<p>
 On 19 February 2010, Japanese officials said that
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 's Togo registry had been withdrawn. On 24 May 2010, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society stated that
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 was now registered under the Dutch flag.

 After her African refit,
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 departed Mauritius on 18 December 2009 to join up with the MY
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 and MY
 <i>
  Ady Gil
 </i>
 , the two other Sea Shepherd vessels. One of its first actions was to take video footage of the collision between
 <i>
  Ady Gil
 </i>
 and a Japanese security vessel, after which she took aboard the crew from the stricken Sea Shepherd craft.

<p>
 On 6 February 2010, while obstructing the slip-way of
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru
 </i>
 factory ship,
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 collided with
 <i>
  Yūshin Maru No. 3
 </i>
 , resulting in a 3-foot-4-inch (1.02 m) gash in
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 's hull above the waterline. The Institute of Cetacean Research reported minor damage to a handrail and to the hull of its ship. Both Sea Shepherd and the ICR accused the other of intentionally causing the crash.
</p>
<p>
 On 25 February 2010, Sea Shepherd reported that
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 , which had been following the whaling fleet after
 <i>
  Steve Irwin
 </i>
 broke off pursuit to return to port, was suffering from a fuel valve problem and would be returning to port, ending the organisation's operations for the 2009–2010 whaling season.
</p>
<p>
 On 9 February 2011, Sea Shepherd reported that
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 , which had been searching for the whaling fleet alongside the Sea Shepherd vessel
 <i>
  Gojira

 ) began blocking
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru'
 </i>
 s slipway. On 18 February 2011, after being aggressively tailed by
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 for over 3,000 nmi (5,556 km),
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru
 </i>
 changed course and headed towards Japan, cutting short the 2010–11 whaling season.
</p>
<p>
 On 5 March 2012, Sea Shepherd reported that after a lengthy search
 <i>
  Bob Barker
 </i>
 found the whaling fleet's factory ship,
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru
 </i>
 . Three days later, on 8 March 2012, the whalers left the Southern Ocean for the 2011–12 season.

 On 20 February 2013, the Japanese whaling ship
 <i>
  Nisshin Maru
