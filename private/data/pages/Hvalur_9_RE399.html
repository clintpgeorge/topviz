  Hvalur 9 RE399
 </b>
 is an Icelandic whaling ship built in 1952 in Norway. It has been a part of the Icelandic whaling fleet operated and owned by the company Hvalur h/f since 1966. In 1973 she was requisitioned by the Icelandic Coast Guard, repainted, renamed
 <i>
  Týr
 </i>
 and armed with a 57 mm gun and subsequently used to cut the fishing gear from foreign fishing vessels fishing illegally (according to Icelandic law) in a newly claimed fishery zone during the Second Cod War. During her service in the Coast Guard she was usually nicknamed
 <i>
  Hval-Týr
 </i>
 to differentiate from previously commissioned patrol vessels of the same name.

 Between 1987 and 2006, while commercial whaling ceased in Iceland, the ship remained unused at pier but the recommencement of whaling in Iceland brought it back into action.
