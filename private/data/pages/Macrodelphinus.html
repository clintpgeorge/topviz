  <b>
   Macrodelphinus kelloggi
  </b>
 </i>
 was an orca-sized relative of the cetacean
 <i>
  Eurhinodelphis
 </i>
 . It lived off the coast of what is now California during the early Miocene. Because of its size, and inch-long teeth, it is believed to have been an apex predator.

  Macrodelphinus
 </i>
 is known from a fragmentary skull from southern California.
