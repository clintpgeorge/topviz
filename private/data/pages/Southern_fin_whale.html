 The
 <b>
  southern fin whale
 </b>
 (
 <i>
  Balaenoptera physalus quoyi
 </i>
 ) is a subspecies of fin whale that lives in the Southern Ocean. At least one other subspecies of fin whale, the northern fin whale (
 <i>
  B. p. physalus
 </i>
 ), exists in the northern hemisphere.

<h2>
 Taxonomy
</h2>
<p>
 Based on differences in the vertebrae, the Swedish zoologist Einar LÃ¶nnberg (1931) designated
 <i>
  Balaenoptera physalus quoyii
 </i>
 (later the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin (1957) corrected this to
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 ).
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 in turn is based on
 <i>
  Balaena quoyi
 </i>
 (Fischer, 1829), which was the name given to a 16.7 m (55 ft) specimen seen on the shores of the Falkland Islands by Monsieur Quoy and originally named
 <i>
  Balaena rostrata australis
 </i>
 by Desmoulins (1822).

 Size
</h2>
<p>
 Southern fin whales are larger than their northern hemisphere counterparts, with males averaging 20.5 m (67 ft) and females 22 m (72 ft). Maximum reported figures are 25 m (82 ft) for males and 27.3 m (89.5 ft) for females, while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929) were 22.4 m (73' 7" ft) and 24.5 m (80' 5" ft); although Major F. A. Spencer, while whaling inspector of the factory ship
 <i>
  Southern Princess
 </i>
 (1936-38), confirmed the length of a 25.9 m (85 ft) female caught in the Antarctic south of the southern Indian Ocean. At sexual maturity, males average 19.2 m (63 ft) and females 19.9 m (65.3 ft).

<h2>
 Reproduction
</h2>
<p>
 Because of the opposing seasons in each hemisphere,
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 breeds at a different time of the year than
 <i>
  B. p. physalus
 </i>
 . Peak conception for
 <i>
  B. p. quoyi
 </i>
 is June-July, while peak birthing is in May.
