 The
 <b>
  Bolivian river dolphin
 </b>
 (
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis boliviensis
 </i>
 ), a mammal, is a subspecies of the Amazon river dolphin. Although older publications and some recent publications consider the
 <i>
  I. g. boliviensis
 </i>
 population as distinct species from
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis
 </i>
 , much of the scientific community, including the IUCN, consider them to be a subspecies of
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis
 </i>
 . Current classification, therefore, considers them a single species,
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis
 </i>
 , in the genus
 <i>
  Inia
 </i>
 , with three recognized subspecies. However, in 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began considering the Bolivian (
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis boliviensis
 </i>
 ) and Amazonian (
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis
 </i>
 ) subspecies as full species
 <i>
  Inia boliviensis
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis
 </i>
 . A recent study of mitochondrial DNA sequences gave an estimated time of divergence from
 <i>
  I. geoffrensis geoffrensis
 </i>
 of 2.9 million years ago, strengthening the argument for separate species status.

 In September 2012, Bolivian President Evo Morales enacted a law to protect the dolphin and declared it a national treasure.

 French naturalist and palaeontologist Alcide Dessalines d'Orbigny explored South America 1826–1833, including a stay in Bolivia 1831–1833. He returned to France in 1834 and started to describe his scientific explorations, including the new Bolivian cetacean species "
 <i>
  Inia boliviensis
 </i>
 ". In 1847, he and Paul Gervais compared it to "
 <i>
  Delphinius geoffrensis
 </i>
 " (=Amazon river dolphin,
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis
 </i>
 ), which had been described from a stuffed specimen in Lisbon, and the two were considered synonyms for more than a century. In 1973, however, a fresh study concluded that the specimens from Bolivia had more teeth than the specimens from elsewhere and that the rapids and water falls of the Madeira River acted as a barrier, effectively isolating the Bolivian population. The Bolivian river dolphin was therefore made a subspecies,
 <i>
  Inia geoffrensis boliviensis
 </i>
 . Morphological studies later in the 1970s added to the differences between the populations and the specific status
 <i>
  Inia boliviensis
 </i>
 was restored. There is, however, still no consensus on the taxonomic status of the Bolivian population (or that of the Orinoco River population, "
 <i>
  I. g. humboldtiana
 </i>
 ").
