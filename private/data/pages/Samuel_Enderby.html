  Samuel Enderby
 </b>
 (17 January 1719 – 19 September 1797) was an English whale oil merchant. In the 18th century, he founded Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons, a prominent shipping and whaling and sealing company.

 The Enderby family had been tanners at Bermondsey, and supported Oliver Cromwell. Daniel Enderby I raised money for the army in the Long Parliament, as recorded in Hansard. The family was granted forfeited estates at Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland, which were sold in 1660. After that time, the family was active in the 'oil and Russia trade' and traded with the New England colonies.

 On 2 June 1752, Samuel Enderby II married Mary Buxton, a daughter of his business partner at St Paul's Wharf in London. Enderby died in 1797, leaving the company to his three sons Charles, Samuel III, and George.

 Samuel Enderby III (1756-1829) made the first successful whale catch in Australia (10 November 1791), and was the grandfather of Major-General Charles George Gordon.
