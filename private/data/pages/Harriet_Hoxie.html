 First whale oil charter from Honolulu
</h2>

 , 671 tons, Rowland master. 11½ days from San Francisco, to load oil and bone for New Bedford, sailing in November. This was probably the first clipper chartered for this service, to permit whaleships to continue their cruising. Prior shipments of this nature had been largely done by whalers returning east if they had cargo space, otherwise, the lucky "full" ships had to break up their cruise and go home with their catch before the three years' voyage they usually outfitted for was up."
